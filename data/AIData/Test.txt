AB The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations at different fidelity levels are a common tool for predicting the aerodynamic performance in many engineering applications such as; automotive and aerospace to cite a few. However, the associated computational costs with these simulations are not trivial, and using the CFD simulations might easily become unpractical specially at the early design stages. The number of the required CFD simulations could be reduced immensely by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods which can predict, for example, the aerodynamic coefficients based on previous and limited CFD simulations. Having discussed the AI potential to minimize the CFD usage, the objective of this work is to investigate and compare the ability of different AI methods to predict the aerodynamic coefficients using the same CFD database from the literature. In this study, three different AI methods, namely; machine learning (e.g. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), CatBoost, Bagging, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light-GBM), Random Forest (RFR), Gradient Boosting), deep learning (e.g. One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D)) and surrogate models (e.g. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)) have been utilized to estimate a sample CFD database (e.g. NACA0012, RAE2822) from the existing literature, and the prediction performance of these methods have been compared. The results show that, the aerodynamic coefficients predicted using CatBoost, XGB and Bagging are in good agreement with the reference CFD results. Furthermore, the proposed Conv1D method with LeakyReLU activation function showed a promising results in the development of aerodynamic models which can be used in the early stages of the air vehicles design. The obtained results from this work indicate that the CatBoost and the XGB models required much smaller training time compared to the Conv1D method, moreover, the proposed regression trees; CatBoost, Bagging and XGB can reduce the required number of CFD simulations significantly.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) use in automated Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has continuously attracted the research community's interest, motivated by their promising results. Despite their great promise, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of their results, which is a key element for their implementation in clinical practice. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a critical for trustworthy and reliable AI, particularly in safety-critical domains such as medicine. Estimating uncertainty in Machine Learning (ML) model predictions has been extensively used for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under single-label tasks. However, the use of UQ methods in multi-label classification remains underexplored. This study goes beyond developing highly accurate models comparing five uncertainty quantification methods using the same Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture across various validation scenarios, including internal and external validation as well as OOD detection, taking multi-label ECG classification as the example domain. We show the importance of external validation and its impact on classification performance, uncer-tainty estimates quality, and calibration. Ensemble-based methods yield more robust uncertainty estimations than single network or stochastic methods. Although current methods still have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in the case of dataset shift, incorporating uncertainty estimates with a classification with a rejection option improves the ability to detect such changes. Moreover, we show that using uncertainty estimates as a criterion for sample selection in active learning setting results in greater improvements in classification performance compared to random sampling.

AB Background and objective: Obstructive airway diseases, including asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), are two of the most common chronic respiratory health problems. Both of these conditions require health professional expertise in making a diagnosis. Hence, this process is time intensive for healthcare providers and the diagnostic quality is subject to intra-and inter-operator variability. In this study we investigate the role of automated detection of obstructive airway diseases to reduce cost and improve diagnostic quality.Methods: We investigated the existing body of evidence and applied Preferred Reporting Items for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search records in IEEE, Google scholar, and PubMed databases. We identified 65 papers that were published from 2013 to 2022 and these papers cover 67 different studies. The review process was structured according to the medical data that was used for disease detection. We identified six main categories, namely air flow, genetic, imaging, signals, and miscellaneous. For each of these categories, we report both disease detection methods and their performance.Results: We found that medical imaging was used in 14 of the reviewed studies as data for automated obstructive airway disease detection. Genetics and physiological signals were used in 13 studies. Medical records and air flow were used in 9 and 7 studies, respectively. Most papers were published in 2020 and we found three times more work on Machine Learning (ML) when compared to Deep Learning (DL). Statistical analysis shows that DL techniques achieve higher Accuracy (ACC) when compared to ML. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most common DL classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most widely used ML classifier. During our review, we discovered only two publicly available asthma and COPD datasets. Most studies used private clinical datasets, so data size and data composition are inconsistent.Conclusions: Our review results indicate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve both decision quality and efficiency of health professionals during COPD and asthma diagnosis. However, we found several limitations in this review, such as a lack of dataset consistency, a limited dataset and remote monitoring was not sufficiently explored. We appeal to society to accept and trust computer aided airflow obstructive diseases diagnosis and we encourage health professionals to work closely with AI scientists to promote automated detection in clinical practice and hospital settings.

AB Analysis of the effect of pressure on the unsymmetrical plan-shaped buildings due to impact of wind forces is more complicated than the symmetrical plan-shaped buildings. Toward this, the present paper is focuses on the study of the wind effects on the inner face of C-shaped unconventional buildings by considering the surface mean pressure coefficient (Cp over bar ) as the major influencing parameter. Experimental investigation was carried out to obtain the pressure coefficient (Cp) over the surfaces of the C-shaped building models by considering some important configurations like the side ratio, frontal ratio, height ratio, and angle of incidence in a subsonic wind tunnel. In the present study, model equations to predict the Cp over bar are developed by applying various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as the model tree (MT) and group method of data handling (GMDH) with neural network (GMDH-NN) as well as combinatorial (GMDH-C) algorithm to the experimental results. In the AI approach, the side width ratio (D/d), frontal ratio (B/d), depth ratio (H/d), relative width ratio (B/b), angle of incidence (& theta;), and face angle (& phi;) are considered as input to the algorithm to develop the model equation for predicting Cp over bar . The performances of the model equations are tested through various statistical error analyses. The importance of input parameters is also analyzed through the sensitivity analysis technique. The results clearly indicate that the proposed GMDH-NN model is the best alternative approach to predict the surface mean pressure coefficient on C-shaped buildings with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and 0.92 during the training and testing phases respectively. To verify the model equation more accurately, the predicted results are also tested through uncertainty analysis which gave satisfactory results for GMDH-NN as compared to MT and GMDH-C, approaches.

TI A user-centred evaluation of DisCERN: Discovering counterfactuals for

SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Counterfactual explanations; Vulnerability detection; Explainable AI
AB Counterfactual explanations highlight actionable knowledge which helps to understand how a machine learning model outcome could be altered to a more favourable outcome. Understanding actionable corrections in source code analysis can be critical to proactively mitigate security attacks that are caused by known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present the DisCERN explainer for discovering counterfactuals for code vulnerability correction. Given a vulnerable code segment, DisCERN finds counterfactual (i.e. non-vulnerable) code segments and recommends actionable corrections. DisCERN uses feature attribution knowledge to identify potentially vulnerable code statements. Subsequently, it applies a substitution-focused correction, suggesting suitable fixes by analysing the nearest-unlike neighbour. Overall, DisCERN aims to identify vulnerabilities and correct them while preserving both the code syntax and the original functionality of the code. A user study evaluated the utility of counterfactuals for vulnerability detection and correction compared to more commonly used feature attribution explainers. The study revealed that counterfactuals foster positive shifts in mental models, effectively guiding users towards making vulnerability corrections. Furthermore, counterfactuals significantly reduced the cognitive load when detecting and correcting vulnerabilities in complex code segments. Despite these benefits, the user study showed that feature attribution explanations are still more widely accepted than counterfactuals, possibly due to the greater familiarity with the former and the novelty of the latter. These findings encourage further research and development into counterfactual explanations, as they demonstrate the potential for acceptability over time among developers as a reliable resource for both coding and training.

AB Cancer is a complex disease that causes abnormal cell growth and spread. DNA mutations, chemical or environmental exposure, viral infections, chronic inflammation, hormone abnormalities, etc., are underlying factors that can cause cancer. Drug resistance and toxicity complicate cancer treatment. Additionally, the variability of cancer makes it difficult to establish universal treatment guidelines. Next-generation sequencing has made genetic testing inexpensive. This uncovers genetic mutations that can be treated with specialty drugs. AI (artificial intelligence), machine learning, biopsy, next-generation sequencing, and digital pathology provide personalized cancer treatment. This allows for patient-specific biological targets and cancer treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T, and cancer vaccines are promising cancer treatments. Recent trial data incorporating these therapies have shown superiority in clinical outcomes and drug tolerability over conventional chemotherapies. Combinations of these therapies with new technology can change cancer treatment and help many. This review discusses the development and challenges of targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), dual variable domain (DVD) antibodies, CAR-T therapy, cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA cancer vaccines, and their clinical outcomes in various cancers. We will also study how artificial intelligence and machine learning help find new cancer treatment targets.

AB The global automobile market experiences quick changes in design preferences. In response to the demand shifts, manufacturers now try to apply new technologies to bring a novel design to market faster. In this paper, we introduce a novel AI application that performs a similarity verification task of wheel designs that aims to solve the real-world problem. Through the deep metric learning approach, we empirically prove that the cross-entropy loss does similar tasks as the pairwise losses do in the embedding space. On Jan 2022, we successfully transitioned the verification system to the wheel design process of Hyundai Motor Company's design team and shortened the verification time by 90% to a maximum of 10 min. With a few clicks, the designers at Hyundai Motor could take advantage of our verification system.

AB Background: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the most lethal cancers. The lack of effective tools for early detection results in late tumor detection and, consequently, high mortality rate. Precision oncology aims to develop targeted individual treatments based on advanced computational approaches of omics data. Biomarkers, such as global alteration of cytosine (CpG) methylation, can be pivotal for these objectives. In this study, we performed DNA methylation profiling of pancreatic cancer patients using circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and artificial intelligence (AI) including Deep Learning (DL) for minimally invasive detection to elucidate the epigenetic pathogenesis of PC.Methods: The Illumina Infinium HD Assay was used for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of cfDNA in treatment-naive patients. Six AI algorithms were used to determine PC detection accuracy based on cytosine (CpG) methylation markers. Additional strategies for minimizing overfitting were employed. The molecular pathogenesis was interrogated using enrichment analysis.Results: In total, we identified 4556 significantly differentially methylated CpGs (q-value < 0.05; Bonferroni correction) in PC versus controls. Highly accurate PC detection was achieved with all 6 AI platforms (Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve [0.90-1.00]). For example, DL achieved AUC (95% CI): 1.00 (0.95-1.00), with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. A separate modeling approach based on logistic regression-based yielded an AUC (95% CI) 1.0 (1.0-1.0) with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for PC detection. The top four biological pathways that were epigenetically altered in PC and are known to be linked with cancer are discussed.Conclusion: Using a minimally invasive approach, AI, and epigenetic analysis of circulating cfDNA, high predictive accuracy for PC was achieved. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that that early detection leading to improved overall survival may be achievable in the future.

TI Complexity of minimum-size arc-inconsistency explanations
SO CONSTRAINTS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Constraint programming; Constraint propagation; Minimum explanations;
   Complexity
AB Explaining the outcome of programs has become one of the main concerns in AI research. In constraint programming, a user may want the system to explain why a given variable assignment is not feasible or how it came to the conclusion that the problem does not have any solution. One solution to the latter is to return to the user a sequence of simple reasoning steps that lead to inconsistency. Arc consistency is a well-known form of reasoning that can be understood by a human. We consider explanations as sequences of propagation steps of a constraint on a variable (i.e. the ubiquitous revise function in arc-consistency algorithms) that lead to inconsistency. We characterize several cases for which providing a shortest such explanation is easy: For instance when constraints are binary and variables have maximum degree two. However, these polynomial cases are tight. For instance, providing a shortest explanation is NP-hard when constraints are binary and the maximum degree is three, even if the number of variables is bounded. It remains NP-hard on trees, despite the fact that arc consistency is a decision procedure on trees. The problem is not even FPT-approximable unless the FPT not equal W[2] hypothesis is false.

AB Automated fault diagnosis can facilitate diagnostics assistance, speedier troubleshooting, and better-organised logistics. Currently, most AI-based prognostics and health management in the automotive industry ignore textual descriptions of the experienced problems or symptoms. With this study, however, we propose an ML-assisted workflow for automotive fault nowcasting that improves on current industry standards. We show that a multilingual pre-trained Transformer model can effectively classify the textual symptom claims from a large company with vehicle fleets, despite the task's challenging nature due to the 38 languages and 1357 classes involved. Overall, we report an accuracy of more than 80% for high-frequency classes and above 60% for classes with reasonable minimum support, bringing novel evidence that automotive troubleshooting management can benefit from multilingual symptom text classification.

AB Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many aspects of scholarly publishing. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors might use AI in a variety of ways, and those uses might augment their existing work or might instead be intended to replace it. We are editors of bioethics and humanities journals who have been contemplating the implications of this ongoing transformation. We believe that generative AI may pose a threat to the goals that animate our work but could also be valuable for achieving those goals. In the interests of fostering a wider conversation about how generative AI may be used, we have developed a preliminary set of recommendations for its use in scholarly publishing. We hope that the recommendations and rationales set out here will help the scholarly community navigate toward a deeper understanding of the strengths, limits, and challenges of AI for responsible scholarly work.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in service recovery is transforming the frontline interfaces across the tourism industry, as AI chatbots are now being designed to show empathy. Using a multi-method approach combining survey, experimental, and field data obtained from hotel guests, this study explores the effects of chatbot-employee collaborative empathic responses on customer retention under various service-recovery contexts. It finds that congruence (vs. incongruence) and higher (vs. lower) levels of congruence in chatbot-employee empathic responses more effectively retain customers. Further, the effects of incongruence and congruence on customer retention diminish when the chatbot's identity is disclosed but are strengthened when employees' acceptance of a chatbot increases. Only the negative effects of empathic response incongruence correspondingly increase when chatbot efficiency and flexibility (ambidexterity) increase. These findings suggest that tourism practitioners can rely on chatbot-employee collaboration to accomplish service-recovery tasks but should pay attention to chatbot-side and employee-side uncertainties in a service triad, especially chatbot ambidexterity.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Background: Olfactory dysfunction can negatively impact the quality of life and increase the risk of danger from warning odors. Various factors can cause olfactory dysfunction, including COVID-19 infection, which has increased anosmia cases. No medications are approved; however, recent studies have suggested that intranasal insulin could effectively treat olfactory dysfunction. Aim: To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intranasal insulin in treating olfactory dysfunction. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL databases were searched using specific keywords, and the outputs were screened using the Rayyan AI system. Original research articles published without time frame limitations that reported the relevant outcomes were included. The reviewers performed the screening and data extraction, and any disagreements were resolved by a third senior author. Results: This systematic review identified 66 references from 3 databases, with 45 articles meeting the criteria for review after duplicates were removed. Six articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected, including 177 subjects. The selected studies consisted of various study designs, including pilot studies, placebo-controlled trials, crossover studies, and randomized clinical trials. The findings showed that intranasal insulin therapy had beneficial effects on olfactory function. Specifically, improvements were observed in olfactory detection and discrimination in patients with post-COVID-19 anosmia, olfactory threshold performance in healthy participants, and odor identification in hyposmic patients. However, there were variations in the observed effects based on different doses of insulin administered and gender differences. It also shows that using insulin provides good outcomes. Using it intranasally was safe and did not cause any complications. Conclusion: Intranasal insulin has shown promising results as a potentially safe treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Studies suggest that it can improve olfactory thresholds. Further studies are needed to investigate optimal doses and potential gender differences in response.

AB BackgroundWith the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care, AI chatbots like ChatGPT-4 are being used to deliver health information.ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the capability of ChatGPT-4 in answering common questions related to abdominoplasty, evaluating its potential as an adjunctive tool in patient education and preoperative consultation.MethodsA variety of common questions about abdominoplasty were submitted to ChatGPT-4. These questions were sourced from a question list provided by the American Society of Plastic Surgery to ensure their relevance and comprehensiveness. An experienced plastic surgeon meticulously evaluated the responses generated by ChatGPT-4 in terms of informational depth, response articulation, and competency to determine the proficiency of the AI in providing patient-centered information.ResultsThe study showed that ChatGPT-4 can give clear answers, making it useful for answering common queries. However, it struggled with personalized advice and sometimes provided incorrect or outdated references. Overall, ChatGPT-4 can effectively share abdominoplasty information, which may help patients better understand the procedure. Despite these positive findings, the AI needs more refinement, especially in providing personalized and accurate information, to fully meet patient education needs in plastic surgery.ConclusionsAlthough ChatGPT-4 shows promise as a resource for patient education, continuous improvements and rigorous checks are essential for its beneficial integration into healthcare settings. The study emphasizes the need for further research, particularly focused on improving the personalization and accuracy of AI responses.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

AB BackgroundSince 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses have spread from Asia worldwide, infecting poultry, humans and wild birds. Subsequently, global interest in avian influenza (AI) surveillance increased.ObjectivesMongolia presents an opportunity to study viruses in wild birds because the country has very low densities of domestic poultry and supports large concentrations of migratory water birds.MethodsWe conducted AI surveillance in Mongolia over two time periods, 2009-2013 and 2016-2018, utilizing environmental fecal sampling. Fresh fecal samples were collected from water bird congregation sites. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of positive samples were identified through viral isolation or molecular assays, with pathogenicity determined by HA subtype or sequencing the HA cleavage site.ResultsA total of 10,222 samples were collected. Of these, 7,025 fecal samples were collected from 2009 to 2013, and 3,197 fecal samples were collected from 2016 to 2018. Testing revealed 175 (1.7%) positive samples for low-pathogenicity influenza A, including 118 samples from 2009 to 2013 (1.7%) and 57 samples from 2016 to 2018 (1.8%). HA and NA subtyping of all positives identified 11 subtypes of HA and nine subtypes of NA in 29 different combinations. Within periods, viruses were detected more frequently during the fall season than in the early summer.ConclusionMongolia's critical wild bird habitat is positioned as a crossroad of multiple migratory flyways. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using an affordable environmental fecal sampling approach for AI surveillance and contributes to understanding the prevalence and ecology of low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in this important location, where birds from multiple flyways mix.
   Collected a total of 10,222 fecal samples from wild birds in Mongolia between 2009-2013 and 2016-2018 and found 175 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses of 29 subtype combinations.During these time periods, the viruses were more frequently detected in the fall season (August to October) compared with the early summer (April to July).The study demonstrates the use of a cost-effective fecal sampling approach for monitoring avian influenza in wild bird populations and contributes to our understanding of the prevalence and ecology of these viruses in Mongolia, a country with a globally important habitat for large concentrations of migratory water birds.image

AB Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate consumers' emotional responses to artificial intelligence (AI) defeating people. Meanwhile, the authors investigate the negative spillover effect of AI defeating people on consumers' attitudes toward AI companies. The authors also try to alleviate this spillover effect. Design/methodology/approach - Using four studies to test the hypotheses. In Study 1, the authors use the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers algorithm to run a sentiment analysis to investigate how AI defeating people influences consumers' emotions. In Studies 2 to 4, the authors test the effect of AI defeating people on consumers' attitudes, the mediating effect of negative emotions and the moderating effect of different intentions. Findings - The authors find that AI defeating people increases consumers' negative emotions. In terms of downstream consequences, AI defeating people induces a spillover effect on consumers' unfavorable attitudes toward AI companies. Emphasizing the intention of helping people can effectively mitigate this negative spillover effect. Practical implications - The authors' findings remind governments, policymakers and AI companies to pay attention to the negative effect of AI defeating people and take reasonable steps to alleviate this negative effect. The authors help consumers rationally understand this phenomenon and correctly control and reduce unnecessary negative emotions in the AI era. Originality/value - This paper is the first study to examine the adverse effects of AI defeating humans. The authors contribute to research on the dark side of AI, the outcomes of competition matches and the method to analyze emotions in user-generated content (UGC).

AB BackgroundThe identification of the electrical stimulation parameters for neuromodulation is a subject-specific and time-consuming procedure that presently mostly relies on the expertise of the user (e.g., clinician, experimenter, bioengineer). Since the parameters of stimulation change over time (due to displacement of electrodes, skin status, etc.), patients undergo recurrent, long calibration sessions, along with visits to the clinics, which are inefficient and expensive. To address this issue, we developed an automatized calibration system based on reinforcement learning (RL) allowing for accurate and efficient identification of the peripheral nerve stimulation parameters for somatosensory neuroprostheses.MethodsWe developed an RL algorithm to automatically select neurostimulation parameters for restoring sensory feedback with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). First, the algorithm was trained offline on a dataset comprising 49 subjects. Then, the neurostimulation was then integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) to create an intuitive AI-based mapping platform enabling the user to autonomously perform the sensation characterization procedure. We assessed the algorithm against the performance of both experienced and naive and of a brute force algorithm (BFA), on 15 nerves from five subjects. Then, we validated the AI-based platform on six neuropathic nerves affected by distal sensory loss.ResultsOur automatized approach demonstrated the ability to find the optimal values of neurostimulation achieving reliable and comfortable elicited sensations. When compared to alternatives, RL outperformed the naive and BFA, significantly decreasing the time for mapping and the number of delivered stimulation trains, while improving the overall quality. Furthermore, the RL algorithm showed performance comparable to trained experimenters. Finally, we exploited it successfully for eliciting sensory feedback in neuropathic patients.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrated that the AI-based platform based on a RL algorithm can automatically and efficiently calibrate parameters for somatosensory nerve stimulation. This holds promise to avoid experts' employment in similar scenarios, thanks to the merging between AI and neurotech. Our RL algorithm has the potential to be used in other neuromodulation fields requiring a mapping process of the stimulation parameters.Trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov (Identifier: NCT04217005)ConclusionsOur findings demonstrated that the AI-based platform based on a RL algorithm can automatically and efficiently calibrate parameters for somatosensory nerve stimulation.

ID FRAMEWORK; LAW
AB Legal prediction presents one of the most significant challenges when applying artificial intelligence (AI) to the legal field. The legal system is a complex adaptive system characterized by the ambiguity of legal language and the diversity of value functions. The imprecision and procedural knowledge inherent in law makes judicial issues difficult to be expressed in a computer symbol system. Current semantic processing and machine learning technologies cannot fully capture the complex nature of legal relations, thereby raising doubts about the accuracy of legal predictions and reliability of judicial models. Cognitive computing, designed to emulate human brain functions and aid in enhancing decision-making processes, offers a better understanding of legal data and the processes of legal reasoning. This paper discusses the advancements made in cognitive methods applied to legal concept learning, semantic extraction, judicial data processing, legal reasoning, understanding of judicial bias, and the interpretability of judicial models. The integration of cognitive neuroscience with law has facilitated several constructive attempts, indicating that the evolution of cognitive law could be the next frontier in the intersection of AI and legal practice.

ID PROBABILITY
AB Background: Breeding objectives are designed to achieve targeted dairy cow production goals, which can be affected by production type, farmer preferences, environmental factors and genetic factors individually or in combination. Breeding practices, such as both controlled and uncontrolled, and artificial insemination (AI) are the tools used to obtain the desired breeding objectives. The lower reproductive performance of indigenous dairy cows affects the total milk production and calf crops that are produced during their lifetime. Designing appropriate breeding objectives and breeding practices can improve the reproductive performance of dairy cows and their overall production performance.
   Materials and methods: The current study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the breeding, practices and performance of indigenous dairy cattle in the south western part of Ethiopia. The districts of Gesha and Chena were purposefully chosen. The study design for the 384 household surveys was a cross-sectional survey with a simple random sample approach. Data analysis was carried out by MS-Excel (2010) and the general linear model procedure of SAS of 2008.
   Results: The current study revealed that methods of breeding were predominantly natural-controlled mating, followed by natural-uncontrolled mating and AI in descending order. Breeding objectives were input function, output function, sociocultural and economic functions and assets and security functions in decreasing order of rank. Reproduction performance indexes of indigenous dairy cows age at first service (3.72 +/- 0.05 years), age at first calving (AFC) (4.71 +/- 0.07 years), calving interval (CI) (1.58 +/- 0.03 years), days open (DO) (4.26 +/- 0.11 months), services per conception in natural mating (1.4 +/- 0.08) and AI (2.73 +/- 0.14), age of bull at maturity (4.17 +/- 0.74 years), interoestrus interval (23.18 +/- 0.61 days), calves crop (7.53 +/- 0.22) and the life span of indigenous dairy cow (11.94 +/- 0.26 years) were significant (p < 0.01) between two districts, whereas the values of age of bull at maturity and number of services per conception in naturalmating were significant (p < 0.05) between districts.
   Conclusions: Using AI and major reproduction performances, such as AFC, CI and DO of indigenous dairy cows in the study area, were very low. Therefore, concerned bodies should intervene to improve reproduction performance through the utilization of AI techniques, with the integration of forage development activities and improvements in livestock health care.

AB The current study was performed to determine the effect of dietary vitamin E, sesamin and thymoquinone bioactive lignans derived from sesame and black seed on immunological response, intestinal traits and Mucin(2) gene expression in broiler quails. Three hundred and fifty (one days-old) quails were allotted to seven dietary treatments with five replicates as an experimental randomized design study. Treatments were basal diet as a control, control +100 and +200 mg of vitamin E, sesamin and thymoquinone per each kg of diet respectively. At 35 d of age, two quails from each pen were chosen, weighted, slaughtered, eviscerated and lymphoid organ relative weights were measured. Anti-body titers against Newcastle disease (ND), Sheep red blood cell (SRBC), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and Avian influenza (AI) vaccination were determined. The serum activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and serum antioxidant activates such as superoxide dismutase (SOD),glutathione peroxidase(GPX), catalase (CAT) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were examined. The cell mediated immunity by dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) challenges were assessed. The microflora populations of ileum, morphological traits of jejunum and mucin(2) gene expression were analyzed. Data showed that the lymphoid organ (thymus, spleen and Bursa) relative weights and antibody titer against HI, AI, SRBC and IB vaccination were increased compared to the control (p <= 0.05). Serum activities of ALP, ALT and AST were decreased under influences of dietary treatments (p <= 0.05). The serum antioxidant activates of GPX,SOD,CAT and TAC were increased and Increasing in mean skin thickness after DNCB challenge and decrease wing web swelling response to PHA mitojen injection were observed (p <= 0.05). Salmonella enterica, E-coli and Coliforms colonies were decrease and Lactobacillus colonies increased instead (p <= 0.05). The villus height and surface, crypt depth and goblet cells density were increased compared to the control (p <= 0.05). The expression of MUC2 gene increased under influnces of vitamin E, sesamin and thymoquinone supplemented diets (p <= 0.05).

TI Bone marrow fibrosis is associated with non-response to CD19 CAR T-cell
   therapy in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy is used to treat relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The role of the pre-CAR bone marrow (BM) stromal microenvironment in determining response to CAR T-cell therapy has been understudied. We performed whole transcriptome analysis, reticulin fibrosis assessment and CD3 T-cell infiltration on BM core biopsies from pre- and post-CAR timepoints for 61 patients, as well as on a cohort of 54 primary B-ALL samples. Pathways of fibrosis, extracellular matrix development, and associated transcription factors AP1 and TGF-beta 3, were enriched and upregulated in nonresponders (NR) even prior to CAR T cell therapy. NR showed significantly higher levels of BM fibrosis compared to complete responders by both clinical reticulin assessment and AI-assisted digital image scoring. CD3+ T cells showed a trend toward lower infiltration in NR. NR had significantly higher levels of pre-CAR fibrosis compared to primary B-ALL. High levels of fibrosis were associated with lower overall survival after CAR T-cell therapy. In conclusion, BM fibrosis is a novel mechanism mediating nonresponse to CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy in B-ALL. A widely used clinically assay for quantitating myelofibrosis can be repurposed to determine patients at high risk of nonresponse. Genes and pathways associated with BM fibrosis are a potential target to improve response.

AB Introduction: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age and remains widely underdiagnosed leading to significant morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) hold promise in improving diagnostics. Thus, we performed a systematic review of literature to identify the utility of AI/ML in the diagnosis or classification of PCOS.Methods: We applied a search strategy using the following databases MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Web of Science, and the IEEE Xplore Digital Library using relevant keywords. Eligible studies were identified, and results were extracted for their synthesis from inception until January 1, 2022.Results: 135 studies were screened and ultimately, 31 studies were included in this study. Data sources used by the AI/ML interventions included clinical data, electronic health records, and genetic and proteomic data. Ten studies (32%) employed standardized criteria (NIH, Rotterdam, or Revised International PCOS classification), while 17 (55%) used clinical information with/without imaging. The most common AI techniques employed were support vector machine (42% studies), K-nearest neighbor (26%), and regression models (23%) were the commonest AI/ML. Receiver operating curves (ROC) were employed to compare AI/ML with clinical diagnosis. Area under the ROC ranged from 73% to 100% (n=7 studies), diagnostic accuracy from 89% to 100% (n=4 studies), sensitivity from 41% to 100% (n=10 studies), specificity from 75% to 100% (n=10 studies), positive predictive value (PPV) from 68% to 95% (n=4 studies), and negative predictive value (NPV) from 94% to 99% (n=2 studies).Conclusion: Artificial intelligence and machine learning provide a high diagnostic and classification performance in detecting PCOS, thereby providing an avenue for early diagnosis of this disorder. However, AI-based studies should use standardized PCOS diagnostic criteria to enhance the clinical applicability of AI/ML in PCOS and improve adherence to methodological and reporting guidelines for maximum diagnostic utility.Systematic review registration https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42022295287.

AB The landscape of ophthalmology has observed monumental shifts with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This article is devoted to elaborating on the nuanced application of AI in the diagnostic realm of anterior segment eye diseases, an area ripe with potential yet complex in its imaging characteristics. Historically, AI's entrenchment in ophthalmology was predominantly rooted in the posterior segment. However, the evolution of machine learning paradigms, particularly with the advent of deep learning methodologies, has reframed the focus. When combined with the exponential surge in available electronic image data pertaining to the anterior segment, AI's role in diagnosing corneal, conjunctival, lens, and eyelid pathologies has been solidified and has emerged from the realm of theoretical to practical. In light of this transformative potential, collaborations between the Ophthalmic Imaging and Intelligent Medicine Subcommittee of the China Medical Education Association and the Ophthalmology Committee of the International Translational Medicine Association have been instrumental. These eminent bodies mobilized a consortium of experts to dissect and assimilate advancements from both national and international quarters. Their mandate was not limited to AI's application in anterior segment pathologies like the cornea, conjunctiva, lens, and eyelids, but also ventured into deciphering the existing impediments and envisioning future trajectories. After iterative deliberations, the consensus synthesized herein serves as a touchstone, assisting ophthalmologists in optimally integrating AI into their diagnostic decisions and bolstering clinical research. Through this guideline, we aspire to offer a comprehensive framework, ensuring that clinical decisions are not merely informed but transformed by AI. By building upon existing literature yet maintaining the highest standards of originality, this document stands as a testament to both innovation and academic integrity, in line with the ethos of renowned journals such as Ophthalmology.

AB Although technology advancements provide opportunities for social interactions, reports show that people have never felt so alone and are increasingly adopting AI friendship and therapy-related well-being apps. By adopting a mixed-method approach (i.e., netnography and quantitative survey), we investigate the extent AI friendship apps enhance users' well-being-and to what extent they further exacerbate issues of using technology for social needs. Findings show that users of AI friendship apps report well-being benefits from the relationship with the AI friend and, at the same time, find themselves being addicted to using the app. Specifically, we show that users' loneliness and fear of judgment, together with AI sentience and perceived well-being gained, increase addiction to the app, while AI ubiquity and warmth reduce it. Taken together, the results show that despite the intended positive purpose of the apps, the negative effects that AI friendship apps have on well-being may be much greater.

AB BackgroundVision transformer-based methods are advancing the field of medical artificial intelligence and cancer imaging, including lung cancer applications. Recently, many researchers have developed vision transformer-based AI methods for lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.ObjectiveThis scoping review aims to identify the recent developments on vision transformer-based AI methods for lung cancer imaging applications. It provides key insights into how vision transformers complemented the performance of AI and deep learning methods for lung cancer. Furthermore, the review also identifies the datasets that contributed to advancing the field.MethodsIn this review, we searched Pubmed, Scopus, IEEEXplore, and Google Scholar online databases. The search terms included intervention terms (vision transformers) and the task (i.e., lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, etc.). Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract to select relevant studies and performed the data extraction. A third reviewer was consulted to validate the inclusion and exclusion. Finally, the narrative approach was used to synthesize the data.ResultsOf the 314 retrieved studies, this review included 34 studies published from 2020 to 2022. The most commonly addressed task in these studies was the classification of lung cancer types, such as lung squamous cell carcinoma versus lung adenocarcinoma, and identifying benign versus malignant pulmonary nodules. Other applications included survival prediction of lung cancer patients and segmentation of lungs. The studies lacked clear strategies for clinical transformation. SWIN transformer was a popular choice of the researchers; however, many other architectures were also reported where vision transformer was combined with convolutional neural networks or UNet model. Researchers have used the publicly available lung cancer datasets of the lung imaging database consortium and the cancer genome atlas. One study used a cluster of 48 GPUs, while other studies used one, two, or four GPUs.ConclusionIt can be concluded that vision transformer-based models are increasingly in popularity for developing AI methods for lung cancer applications. However, their computational complexity and clinical relevance are important factors to be considered for future research work. This review provides valuable insights for researchers in the field of AI and healthcare to advance the state-of-the-art in lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to identify the historical trends and status of the national development of artificial intelligence (AI) from a nationwide perspective and to enable governments at different administrative levels to promote AI development through policymaking.Design/methodology/approachThis paper analyzed 248 Chinese AI policies (36 issued by the state agencies and 212 by the regional agencies). Policy bibliometrics, policy instruments and network analysis were used to reveal the AI policy patterns. Three aspects were analyzed: the spatiotemporal distribution of issued policies, the policy foci and instruments of policy contents and the cooperation and citation among policy-issuing agencies.FindingsResults indicate that Chinese AI development is still in the initial phase. During the policymaking processes, the state and regional policy foci have strong consistency; however, the coordination among state and regional agencies is supposed to be strengthened. According to the issuing time of AI policies, Chinese AI development is in accordance with the global situation and has witnessed unprecedented growth in the last five years. And the coastal provinces have issued more targeted policies than the middle and western provinces. Governments at the state and regional levels have emphasized familiar policy foci and played the role of policymakers, along with regional governments that also functioned as policy executors as well. According to the three-dimension instruments coding, the authors found an uneven structure of policy instruments at both levels. Furthermore, weak cooperation appears at the state level, while little cooperation is found among regional agencies. Regional governments cite state policies, thus leading to the formation of top-down diffusion, lacking bottom-up diffusion.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to the literature by characterizing policy patterns from both external attributes and semantic contents, thus revealing features of policy distribution, contents and agencies. What is more, this research analyzes Chinese AI policies from a nationwide perspective, which contributes to clarifying the overall status and multi-level relationships of policies. The findings also benefit the coordinated development of governments during further policymaking processes.

ID EPIGASTRIC PERFORATOR FLAP; CT ANGIOGRAPHY; EFFICIENCY
AB Autologous breast reconstruction surgery is a vital part of the recovery process for patients with breast cancer. While various reconstructive options exist, the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap is often favoured for its ability to closely mimic natural breast tissue. However, the complex vascular anatomy associated with the deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEA) presents challenges for surgeons during DIEP flap execution. Preoperative imaging, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA), is commonly used to understand vascular architecture and aid in selecting appropriate perforators. Conventional reporting of CTA scans is a labour-intensive process that can be challenging and requires specific expertise. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms in medical imaging has the potential to address these challenges. AI can enhance CTA through improved data acquisition, image post-processing, and potentially interpretation. By automating the perforator selection process, AI applications can significantly reduce the time spent on preoperative imaging analysis and potentially improve accuracy and reliability. While AI shows promise in optimizing efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in breast reconstruction planning, challenges and ethical considerations need to be addressed. This article explores the challenges, opportunities, and future directions of using AI in the preoperative planning of autologous breast reconstruction.

AB Implementing intelligent irrigation and adjusting the irrigation system is essential in today's agricultural system to control the amount of water required for the plant. This study focuses on data obtained from sensors measuring (soil temperature and humidity, temperature and humidity of ambient and light) and image processing of plant leaves. To analyze the data, two models were implemented including a regression model in SPSS software and another model by genetic programming in MATLAB 2018 software. The optimal model was a combined model of sensors and images in genetic programming with higher R2 and lower standard error of 0.88 and 0.03, respectively. This model was superior to the regression model which had an R2 and standard error of 0.86 and 0.21, respectively, so this optimal model was selected to adjust the microcontroller for the intelligent irrigation system. The following year by replanting the crop, the intelligent irrigation system was presented as the superior system with 11% water saving compared to the previous year (irrigation by the user). Also, no changes were observed in the yield and color indicators of the plant at the level of 5%, which indicates the superiority of the intelligent irrigation system and its high accuracy of this system.

AB In this article, I assess (1) whether some cyborgs and AI robots can theoretically be considered persons; and (2) how we will know if/when they have attained personhood. Since our discourses of personhood are inherently pluralistic and our concepts of both humanness and personhood are inherently nebulous, both some cyborgs, and some AI robots, I conclude, could theoretically be considered persons depending on what, exactly, one means by "person." The practical problem of how we distinguish them from nonpersonal AI entities is, however, both more important, and much more difficult to solve. In conversation with various secular and theological accounts of relational personhood, I argue that only by treating AI entities as persons by default might we avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of mistakenly denying personhood to an entire group of eligible entities.

AB Background and Objectives: Burn injuries range from minor medical issues to severe, life-threatening conditions. The severity and location of the burn dictate its treatment; while minor burns might be treatable at home, severe burns necessitate medical intervention, sometimes in specialized burn centers with extended follow-up care. This study aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) to forecast potential adverse effects in burn patients. Methods: This retrospective analysis considered burn patients admitted to Chi Mei Medical Center from 2010 to 2019. The study employed 14 features, comprising supplementary information like prior comorbidities and laboratory results, for building models for predicting graft surgery, a prolonged hospital stay, and overall adverse effects. Overall, 70% of the data set trained the AI models, with the remaining 30% reserved for testing. Three ML algorithms of random forest, LightGBM, and logistic regression were employed with evaluation metrics of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: In this research, out of 224 patients assessed, the random forest model yielded the highest AUC for predictions related to prolonged hospital stays (>14 days) at 81.1%, followed by the XGBoost (79.9%) and LightGBM (79.5%) models. Besides, the random forest model of the need for a skin graft showed the highest AUC (78.8%), while the random forest model and XGBoost model of the occurrence of adverse complications both demonstrated the highest AUC (87.2%) as well. Based on the best models with the highest AUC values, an AI prediction system is designed and integrated into hospital information systems to assist physicians in the decision-making process. Conclusions: AI techniques showcased exceptional capabilities for predicting a prolonged hospital stay, the need for a skin graft, and the occurrence of overall adverse complications for burn patients. The insights from our study fuel optimism for the inception of a novel predictive model that can seamlessly meld with hospital information systems, enhancing clinical decisions and bolstering physician-patient dialogues.

AB This paper presents the models developed for the short-term forecasting of energy production by photovoltaic panels. An analysis of a set of weather factors influencing daily energy production is presented. Determining the correlation between the produced direct current (DC) energy and the individual weather parameters allowed the selection of the potentially best explanatory factors, which served as input data for the neural networks. The forecasting models were based on MLP and Elman-type networks. An appropriate selection of structures and learning parameters was carried out, as well as the process of learning the models. The models were built based on different time periods: year-round, semi-annual, and seasonal. The models were developed separately for monocrystalline and amorphous photovoltaic modules. The study compared the models with the predicted and measured insolation energy. In addition, complex forecasting models were developed for the photovoltaic system, which could forecast DC and AC energy simultaneously. The complex models were developed according to the rules of global and local modeling. The forecast errors of the developed models were included. The smallest values of the DC energy forecast errors were achieved for the models designed for summer forecasts. The percentage forecast error was 1.95% using directly measured solar irradiance and 5. 57% using predicted solar irradiance. The complex model for summer forecasted the AC energy with an error of 1.86%.

AB Combined Cycle Power Plants (CCPP) are an effective method for Power generation due to their high thermal efficiency, low fuel consumption, and low greenhouse emissions. However, investing millions into building a power plant without knowledge of the power generation ca-pacity seems unproductive. With the help of AI, we have tried to eliminate this conundrum. The present study focuses on the prediction of power produced by a 747 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP) using a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and compares its results with the actual data from CCPP. BPNN is a regression-based prediction technique that is utilized in this study to develop a predictive model and train it using the following input features: Ambient Temperature, Ambient Pressure, Mass Flow rate of fuel in Gas Turbine 1, and Mass Flow rate of fuel in Gas Turbine 2. The Predictive Model with 10 neurons in the hidden layer was found to be most effective with Mean Squared Error (MSE) value, for the validation dataset, of 0.0063237. CCPP is also analyzed through a thermodynamic model, developed using EES. A detailed energy analysis is carried out and the results were compared with predicted and actual data. It was found that the thermal efficiency and total power generation of actual, predicted, and simulated models were 27.541% & 667.32 MW, 28.238% & 683.48 MW and 28.201% & 683.16 MW, respectively. A parametric study was further carried out to investigate the significance of operating parameters on power output and it was concluded that the temperatures across the Gas turbines have a significant impact on the performance of CCPP. Finally, Methane was replaced by 3 different fuels, one by one, and the effect of each fuel was investigated thermodynamically. It was found that the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of fuel was an important parameter in achieving a higher power output. It can be summarized from this research work that predictive models do have accuracy and such data science techniques can be used as a substitute for extensive thermodynamic calculations.

AB The spatial accessibility of urban parks is an important indicator of the livability level of cities. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive multimodal two-step floating catchment area (CM2SFCA) method which integrates supply capacity, the selection probability of individuals, and variable catchment sizes into the traditional multimodel 2SFCA method. This method is used to measure park accessibility in Wuhan, China. The results show that the spatial distribution of park accessibility under the proposed method is variant. High accessibility areas are clustered near the Third Ring Road with strong supply capacity parks, and low accessibility areas are distributed in the western and southern regions. Compared with the single-model accessibility (bicycling, driving, and public transit) method, we found that the multimodal spatial accessibility, combining the characteristics of three single transportations, can provide a more realistic evaluation. We also explore the spatial relationship between park accessibility and population density by bivariate local Moran's I statistic and find that the Low Ai-High Pi area is located in the center of the study area, and the Low Ai-Low Pi area is located at the edge of the study area, with a relatively discrete distribution of parks and weak supply capacity. These findings may provide some insights for urban planners to formulate effective policies and strategies to ease the spatial inequity of urban parks.

DT Review
DE explainable AI; geospatial ML; evaluation metrics; visualization
AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has the potential to open up black-box machine learning models. XAI can be used to optimize machine learning models, to search for scientific findings, or to improve the understandability of the AI system for the end users. Geospatial XAI refers to AI systems that apply XAI techniques to geospatial data. Geospatial data are associated with geographical locations or areas and can be displayed on maps. This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in the field of geospatial XAI. A structured literature review is used to present and discuss the findings on the main objectives, the implemented machine learning models, and the used XAI techniques. The results show that research has focused either on using XAI in geospatial use cases to improve model quality or on scientific discovery. Geospatial XAI has been used less for improving understandability for end users. The used techniques to communicate the AI analysis results or AI findings to users show that there is still a gap between the used XAI technique and the appropriate visualization method in the case of geospatial data.

AB Systems for monitoring air quality are essential for reducing the negative consequences of air pollution, but creating real-time systems encounters several challenges. The accuracy and effectiveness of these systems can be greatly improved by integrating federated learning and multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art methodologies for federated learning and MEC-enabled air quality monitoring systems. It discusses the immense benefits of federated learning, including privacy-preserving model training, and MEC, such as reduced latency and improved response times, for air quality monitoring applications. Additionally, it highlights the challenges and requirements for developing and implementing real-time air quality monitoring systems, such as data quality, security, and privacy, as well as the need for interpretable and explainable AI-powered models. By leveraging such advanced techniques and technologies, air monitoring systems can overcome various challenges and deliver accurate, reliable, and timely air quality predictions. Moreover, this article provides an in-depth analysis and assessment of the state-of-the-art techniques and emphasizes the need for further research to develop more practical and affordable AI-powered decentralized systems with improved performance and data quality and security while ensuring the ethical and responsible use of the data to support informed decision making and promote sustainability.

ID SCIENCE; ROBOTS
AB The article explores technology-human relations in a time of artificial intelligence (AI) and in the context of long-standing problems in social theory about agency, nonhumans, and autonomy. Most theorizations of AI are grounded in dualistic thinking and traditional views of technology, oversimplifying real-world settings. This article works to unfold modes of existence at play in AI/ human relations. Materials from ethnographic fieldwork are used to highlight the significance of autonomy in AI/human relations. The analysis suggests that the idea of autonomy is a double-edged sword, showing that humans not only coordinate their perception of autonomy but also switch between registers by sometimes ascribing certain autonomous features to the AI system and in other situations denying the system such features. As a result, AI/human relations prove to be not so much determined by any ostensive delegation of tasks as by the way in which AI and humans engage with each other in practice. The article suggests a theory of relationality that redirects focus away from questions of agency towards questions of what it means to be in relations.

AB In this white paper, the ACR Pediatric AI Workgroup of the Commission on Informatics educates the radiology community about the health equity issue of the lack of pediatric artificial intelligence (AI), improves the understanding of relevant pediatric AI issues, and offers solutions to address the inadequacies in pediatric AI development. In short, the design, training, validation, and safe implementation of AI in children require careful and specific approaches that can be distinct from those used for adults. On the eve of widespread use of AI in imaging practice, the group invites the radiology community to align and join Image IntelliGently (www. imageintelligently.org) to ensure that the use of AI is safe, reliable, and effective for children.

AB BackgroundAppropriate skin treatment and care warrants an accurate prediction of skin moisture. However, current diagnostic tools are costly and time-consuming. Stratum corneum moisture content has been measured with moisture content meters or from a near-infrared image. ObjectiveHere, we establish an artificial intelligence (AI) alternative for conventional skin moisture content measurements. MethodsSkin feature factors positively or negatively correlated with the skin moisture content were created and selected by using the PolynomialFeatures(3) of scikit-learn. Then, an integrated AI model using, as inputs, a visible-light skin image and the skin feature factors were trained with 914 skin images, the corresponding skin feature factors, and the corresponding skin moisture contents. ResultsA regression-type AI model using only a visible-light skin-containing image was insufficiently implemented. To improve the accuracy of the prediction of skin moisture content, we searched for new features through feature engineering ("creation of new factors") correlated with the moisture content from various combinations of the existing skin features, and have found that factors created by combining the brown spot count, the pore count, and/or the visually assessed skin roughness give significant correlation coefficients. Then, an integrated AI deep-learning model using a visible-light skin image and these factors resulted in significantly improved skin moisture content prediction. ConclusionSkin moisture content interacts with the brown spot count, the pore count, and/or the visually assessed skin roughness so that better inference of stratum corneum moisture content can be provided using a common visible-light skin photo image and skin feature factors.

AB Recently, the global food supply chain has become increasingly complex, and its scalability has grown. From farm to fork, the performance of food-producing systems is influenced by significant changes in the environment, population and economy. These changes may cause an increase in food fraud and safety hazards and hence, harm human health. Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the food supply chain is one strategy to reduce these hazards. Although the use of AI has been rising in numerous industries, such as precision nutrition, self-driving cars, precision agriculture, precision medicine and food safety, much of what AI systems do is a black box due to its poor explainability. This study covers numerous use cases of food fraud risk prediction using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, SHAP and WIT. We aimed to interpret the predictions of a machine learning model with the aid of these technologies. The case study was performed on a food fraud dataset using adulteration/fraud notifications retrieved from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed system and economically motivated adulteration database. A deep learning model was built based on this dataset and XAI tools have been investigated on the proposed deep learning model. Both features and shortcomings of the current XAI tools in the food fraud area have been presented.

AB Predictive maintenance (PdM) has emerged as a prominent strategy that can recognize the current state and predict the future trend of machines. It helps prevent disastrous breakdowns. Such systems were mostly realized based on artificial intelligence (AI) models that run on resource-rich and power-hungry servers. To meet the ultralow-power, low-cost, and on-device-inferring demands, in this article, we introduce a self-contained low-power on-device PdM (LOPdM) system based on the cutting-edge self-powered sensor (SPS) and tiny machine learning (TinyML) techniques. A rich dataset is collected with an SPS in a simulated vibration environment. The collected data is analyzed using six established AI models. Under an ultrashort data length, small data number, and low sampling rate condition, the random forest (RF) and the deep neural network (DNN) stand out with up to 99% precision. The trained model is then deployed on an embedded system for in situ inferring and condition-based PdM. Power measurement is carefully conducted to compare the power consumption using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) or an SPS, respectively. It shows that the SPS-based system can save up to 66.8% of energy. An all-in-one prototype is assembled and utilized in field tests. It makes a high accuracy in malfunctions identification. As an interdisciplinary study, the development of LOPdM provides valuable guidance for future ubiquitous AI applications.

AB Due primarily to the excellent soft tissue contrast depictions provided by MRI, the widespread application of head and neck MRI in clinical practice serves to assess various diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodologies, particularly deep learning analyses using convolutional neural networks, have recently gained global recognition and have been extensively investigated in clinical research for their applicability across a range of categories within medical imaging, including head and neck MRI. Analytical approaches using AI have shown potential for addressing the clinical limitations associated with head and neck MRI. In this review, we focus primarily on the technical advancements in deep-learning-based methodologies and their clinical utility within the field of head and neck MRI, encompassing aspects such as image acquisition and reconstruction, lesion segmentation, disease classification and diagnosis, and prognostic prediction for patients presenting with head and neck diseases. We then discuss the limitations of current deep-learning-based approaches and offer insights regarding future challenges in this field.

AB Background: The presence of artificial intelligence (AI) in many areas of social life is becoming widespread. The advantages of AI are being observed in medicine, commerce, automobiles, customer service, agriculture and production in factory settings, among others. Workers first encountered robots in the work environment in the 1960s. Since then, intelligent systems have become much more advanced. The expansion of AI functionality in the work environment exacerbates human health risks. These can be physical (lack of adequate machine control, accidents) or psychological (technostress, fear, automation leading to job exclusion, changes in the labour market, widening social differences). Material and Methods: The purpose of this article is to identify, based on selected literature, possible applications of AI and the potential benefits and risks for humans. Results: The main area of interest was the contemporary work environment and the health consequences associated with access to smart technologies. A key research area for us was the re-lationship between AI and increased worker control. Condusions: In the article, the authors emphasize the importance of relevant EU legislation that guarantees respect for the rights of the employed. The authors put forward the thesis that the new reality with the widespread use of AI, requires an analysis of its impact on the human psycho-social and health situation. Thus, a legal framework defining the scope of monitoring and collection of sensitive data is necessary.

AB This study uses retrospective data for firmware tests as the input data sets to train four machine learning models with embedded standalone classifiers. None of these models provide accurate predictions during validation, so model optimization trials adjust the training-validation data portfolio and hyper parameters for each model. Consequently, only the random forest classifier with the best parametric settings just achieves the 90% prediction accuracy required by the standard. Ensemble learning (EL) is then applied using several combinations over the standalone models, and the EL model using logistic regression as the meta classifier increases the accuracy by 6% (i.e. to 96%), which is sufficient for establishing a predictive system. Using the 'X-minute' method, it is further identified that the execution period (also the data sampling period) for the sequential read test workload can be reduced from 30 (in current practice) to 20 minutes and that the predictions are sufficiently accurate for system implementation using the EL model. Applying the similarity confirmation method for each pair of 'score vectors' (each of which contains a model's prediction accuracies), several observations distinguishing the performance and the predictive behavioral patterns of the benchmarked models are further confirmed. The knowledge from this advanced research has implications which may benefit future practice in industry.

AB Purpose of ReviewMany studies have identified positive effects of physiotherapy and exercise for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Most work has thus far focused on the therapeutic modality of exercise as used within physiotherapy programs. Stimulated by these positive findings, there is now a strong move to take exercise out of the clinical setting and to deliver the interventions in the community. Although the goals and effects of many such community-based exercise programs overlap with those of physiotherapy, it has also become more clear that both exercise modalities also differ in various ways. Here, we aim to comprehensively review the evidence for community-based exercise in PD.Recent FindingsMany different types of community-based exercise for people with PD are emerging and they are increasingly being studied. There is a great heterogeneity considering the types of exercise, study designs, and outcome measures used in research on this subject. While this review is positive regarding the feasibility and potential effects of community-based exercise, it is also evident that the general quality of these studies needs improvement.SummaryBy focusing on community-based exercise, we hope to generate more knowledge on the effects of a wide range of different exercise modalities that can be beneficial for people with PD. This knowledge may help people with PD to select the type and setting of exercise activity that matches best with their personal abilities and preferences. As such, these insights will contribute to an improved self-management of PD.

AB ImportanceArtificial intelligence (AI) training for diagnosing dermatologic images requires large amounts of clean data. Dermatologic images have different compositions, and many are inaccessible due to privacy concerns, which hinder the development of AI.ObjectiveTo build a training data set for discriminative and generative AI from unstandardized internet images of melanoma and nevus.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsIn this diagnostic study, a total of 5619 (CAN5600 data set) and 2006 (CAN2000 data set; a manually revised subset of CAN5600) cropped lesion images of either melanoma or nevus were semiautomatically annotated from approximately 500 000 photographs on the internet using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), region-based CNNs, and large mask inpainting. For unsupervised pretraining, 132 673 possible lesions (LESION130k data set) were also created with diversity by collecting images from 18 482 websites in approximately 80 countries. A total of 5000 synthetic images (GAN5000 data set) were generated using the generative adversarial network (StyleGAN2-ADA; training, CAN2000 data set; pretraining, LESION130k data set).Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for determining malignant neoplasms was analyzed. In each test, 1 of the 7 preexisting public data sets (total of 2312 images; including Edinburgh, an SNU subset, Asan test, Waterloo, 7-point criteria evaluation, PAD-UFES-20, and MED-NODE) was used as the test data set. Subsequently, a comparative study was conducted between the performance of the EfficientNet Lite0 CNN on the proposed data set and that trained on the remaining 6 preexisting data sets.ResultsThe EfficientNet Lite0 CNN trained on the annotated or synthetic images achieved higher or equivalent mean (SD) AUROCs to the EfficientNet Lite0 trained using the pathologically confirmed public data sets, including CAN5600 (0.874 [0.042]; P = .02), CAN2000 (0.848 [0.027]; P = .08), and GAN5000 (0.838 [0.040]; P = .31 [Wilcoxon signed rank test]) and the preexisting data sets combined (0.809 [0.063]) by the benefits of increased size of the training data set.Conclusions and RelevanceThe synthetic data set in this diagnostic study was created using various AI technologies from internet images. A neural network trained on the created data set (CAN5600) performed better than the same network trained on preexisting data sets combined. Both the annotated (CAN5600 and LESION130k) and synthetic (GAN5000) data sets could be shared for AI training and consensus between physicians.

AB What is the educational challenge?Medical schools invest significant resources into the creation of multiple-choice items for assessments. This process is costly and requires faculty training. Recently ChatGPT has been used in various areas to improve content creation efficiency, and it has otherwise been used to answer USMLE-style assessment items.What are the proposed solutions?We proposed the use of ChatGPT to create initial drafts of multiple-choice items.What are the potential benefits to a wider global audience?The use of ChatGPT to generate assessment items can decrease resources required, allowing for the creation of more items, and freeing-up faculty time to perform higher level assessment activities. ChatGPT is also able to consistently produce items using a standard format while adhering to item writing guidelines, which can be very challenging for faculty teams.What are the next steps?We plan to pilot ChatGPT drafted questions and compare item statistics for those written by ChatGPT with those written by our content experts. We also plan to further identify the types of questions that ChatGPT is most appropriate for, and incorporate media into assessment items (e.g. images, videos).

AB Objectives: To train and validate a cloud-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for automated segmentation (AS) of dental implant and attached prosthetic crown on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.
   Methods: A total dataset of 280 maxillomandibular jawbone CBCT scans was acquired from patients who underwent implant placement with or without coronal restoration. The dataset was randomly divided into three subsets: training set (n = 225), validation set (n = 25) and testing set (n = 30). A CNN model was developed and trained using expert-based semi-automated segmentation (SS) of the implant and attached prosthetic crown as the ground truth. The performance of AS was assessed by comparing with SS and manually corrected automated segmentation referred to as refined-automated segmentation (R-AS). Evaluation metrics included timing, voxelwise comparison based on confusion matrix and 3D surface differences.
   Results: The average time required for AS was 60 times faster (<30 s) than the SS approach. The CNN model was highly effective in segmenting dental implants both with and without coronal restoration, achieving a high dice similarity coefficient score of 0.92 +/- 0.02 and 0.91 +/- 0.03, respectively. Moreover, the root mean square deviation values were also found to be low (implant only: 0.08 +/- 0.09 mm, implant+restoration: 0.11 +/- 0.07 mm) when compared with R-AS, implying high AI segmentation accuracy.
   Conclusions: The proposed cloud-based deep learning tool demonstrated high performance and time-efficient segmentation of implants on CBCT images. Clinical significance: AI-based segmentation of implants and prosthetic crowns can minimize the negative impact of artifacts and enhance the generalizability of creating dental virtual models. Furthermore, incorporating the suggested tool into existing CNN models specialized for segmenting anatomical structures can improve presurgical planning for implants and post-operative assessment of peri-implant bone levels.

AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to vertical farms to evaluate whether disrupting technology supports sustainability and increases strategic business model choices in the agricultural sector. The study responds through empirical analysis to the gap on the subject of AI-driven business models present in the growing sector literature.Design/methodology/approachThe paper analyzes the case of "ZERO", a company linked to the strategy innovation ecosystem of the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy. The empirical data were collected through a semi-structured questionnaire, interviews and the analysis of public news on the business model available in the analyzed case study. The research is empirical and uses exploratory, descriptive analysis to interpret the findings. The article focuses on the evaluation of AI impact on the agricultural sector and its potential to create new business models.FindingsThe study identified how AI can support the decision-making process leading to an increase in productivity, efficiency, product quality and cost reduction. AI helps increase these parameters through a continuous learning process and local production, and the possible decrease in prices directed toward the goal of zero km food with fresh products. AI is a winning technology to support the key elements of the vertical farm business model. However, it must be coupled with other devices, such as robots, sensors and drones, to collect enough data to enable continuous learning and improvement.Research limitations/implicationsThe research supports new research trends in AI applied to agriculture. The major implication is the construction of ecosystems between farms, technology providers, policymakers, universities, research centers and local consumer communities.Practical implicationsThe ZERO case study underlines the potential of AI as a destructive technology that, especially in vertical farms, eliminates external conditions by increasing productivity, reducing costs and responding to production needs with adequate consumption of raw materials, boosting both environmental and social sustainability.Originality/valueThe study is original, as the current literature presents few empirical case studies on AI-supporting business models in agriculture. The study also favors valuable strategic implications for the policies to be adopted in favor of new business models in agriculture.

AB Depression is a serious mental health condition that affects a person's ability to feel happy and engaged in activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in depression due to factors such as isolation, financial stress, and uncertainty about the future. Additionally, restrictions on travel and socializing have contributed to feelings of loneliness and isolation. In this research, we present a deep learning framework named CoDeS (COVID-caused depression symptoms) for detecting prodromes of depression in online users caused due to COVID pandemic. This framework uses a combination of CNN, LSTM, and integrated CNN-LSTM techniques, with three different feature representation methods, viz. Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and BERT. Nine experiments were conducted on individual and integrated models, and the results were evaluated based on the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) performance metric. The highest accuracy value of 98.95% was recorded for the TF-IDF-based integrated CNN+LSTM model. When the same integrated model was trained using Word2Vec and BERT-based features, it still performed well with an accuracy of 97.32% and 98.51% respectively. The results demonstrate that the TF-IDF-based feature representation performed better than the Word2Vec and BERT-based feature representations for the CNN and LSTM models in identifying COVID-caused depression symptoms. The proposed approaches showcased substantial advancements over the existing ones, with significant improvements in accuracy. TF-IDF-CNN+LSTM achieved an accuracy approximately 37.28% higher, while BERT-CNN, BERT-LSTM, and BERT-CNN+LSTM achieved accuracy enhancements of approximately 29.78%, 34.44%, and 27.14% respectively. These accuracy improvements demonstrate the superior classification capabilities of the proposed approaches, leading to more precise depression analysis outcomes. In terms of F1 measure, the proposed approaches consistently demonstrated superior performance, with F1 measure values ranging from 0.965 to 0.987. BERT-CNN+LSTM achieved the highest F1 measure, highlighting its balanced precision and recall. Overall, the proposed approaches outperformed existing ones in terms of recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 measure, with improvements ranging from 27.14 to 44.85%. By incorporating advanced techniques such as TF-IDF, CNN, LSTM, and BERT, more accurate and reliable sentiment analysis outcomes can be achieved, offering the potential for enhanced applications in this field.

AB Importance Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained considerable attention in health care, yet concerns have been raised around appropriate methods and fairness. Current AI reporting guidelines do not provide a means of quantifying overall quality of AI research, limiting their ability to compare models addressing the same clinical question.Objective To develop a tool (APPRAISE-AI) to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of AI prediction models for clinical decision support.Design, Setting, and Participants This quality improvement study evaluated AI studies in the model development, silent, and clinical trial phases using the APPRAISE-AI tool, a quantitative method for evaluating quality of AI studies across 6 domains: clinical relevance, data quality, methodological conduct, robustness of results, reporting quality, and reproducibility. These domains included 24 items with a maximum overall score of 100 points. Points were assigned to each item, with higher points indicating stronger methodological or reporting quality. The tool was applied to a systematic review on machine learning to estimate sepsis that included articles published until September 13, 2019. Data analysis was performed from September to December 2022.Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were interrater and intrarater reliability and the correlation between APPRAISE-AI scores and expert scores, 3-year citation rate, number of Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) low risk-of-bias domains, and overall adherence to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.Results A total of 28 studies were included. Overall APPRAISE-AI scores ranged from 33 (low quality) to 67 (high quality). Most studies were moderate quality. The 5 lowest scoring items included source of data, sample size calculation, bias assessment, error analysis, and transparency. Overall APPRAISE-AI scores were associated with expert scores (Spearman rho, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.64-0.91; P < .001), 3-year citation rate (Spearman rho, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.43-0.85; P < .001), number of QUADAS-2 low risk-of-bias domains (Spearman rho, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77; P = .002), and adherence to the TRIPOD statement (Spearman rho, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73-0.94; P < .001). Intraclass correlation coefficient ranges for interrater and intrarater reliability were 0.74 to 1.00 for individual items, 0.81 to 0.99 for individual domains, and 0.91 to 0.98 for overall scores.Conclusions and Relevance In this quality improvement study, APPRAISE-AI demonstrated strong interrater and intrarater reliability and correlated well with several study quality measures. This tool may provide a quantitative approach for investigators, reviewers, editors, and funding organizations to compare the research quality across AI studies for clinical decision support.

ID LATTICE THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY
AB Accurate and explainable artificial-intelligence (AI) models are promising tools for accelerating the discovery of new materials. Recently, symbolic regression has become an increasingly popular tool for explainable AI because it yields models that are relatively simple analytical descriptions of target properties. Due to its deterministic nature, the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method is a particularly promising approach for this application. Here, we describe the new advancements of the SISSO algorithm, as implemented into SISSO++, a C++ code with Python bindings. We introduce a new representation of the mathematical expressions found by SISSO. This is a first step toward introducing "grammar" rules into the feature creation step. Importantly, by introducing a controlled nonlinear optimization to the feature creation step, we expand the range of possible descriptors found by the methodology. Finally, we introduce refinements to the solver algorithms for both regression and classification, which drastically increase the reliability and efficiency of SISSO. For all these improvements to the basic SISSO algorithm, we not only illustrate their potential impact but also fully detail how they operate both mathematically and computationally.

AB IntroductionIn light of escalating concerns regarding global warming and environmental pollution, the pursuit of carbon neutrality has emerged as a pivotal strategy to address climate change on a global scale. As society becomes increasingly conscious of its ecological impact, various sectors, including sports, are urged to embrace environmental responsibility. This study seeks to explore the integration of a carbon neutral framework utilizing artificial intelligence's attention mechanism within the realm of football, with the aim of contributing to football's adoption of carbon neutrality.MethodsThe study commences by introducing an end-to-end architectural framework capable of unifying and optimizing all facets of football to realize a comprehensive carbon-neutral objective. This architecture serves as a consolidated platform for enhancing carbon emission reduction within football pedagogical activities, fostering synergy among diverse constituents while concurrently assessing the equilibrium between carbon reduction and pedagogical effectiveness. Subsequently, attention mechanisms are leveraged to heighten the efficacy and comprehensibility of carbon-neutral strategies. The application of attention mechanisms enables the model to autonomously focus on attributes or regions closely associated with carbon neutrality objectives, thereby facilitating precision and efficacy in recommending carbon neutral strategies. By employing attention mechanisms in football, a more thorough understanding of carbon emissions' dynamics is attained, allowing for the identification of pivotal emission contributors and tailored suggestions for emission mitigation. Furthermore, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method is employed to analyze football time-series data. Given football's intricate sequence of actions, the LSTM technique adeptly captures long-term dependencies, offering improved analysis and optimization of carbon emissions during football activities.ResultsThe integrated end-to-end architectural framework offers a holistic approach to carbon-neutral football strategies. Attention mechanisms effectively enhance the focus and interpretation of carbon-neutral strategies, contributing to precise and impactful recommendations. Employing LSTM for time-series analysis aids in comprehending carbon emission dynamics, enabling the identification of efficacious carbon neutral strategies. The study underscores the potential of AI-driven attention mechanisms and LSTM in fostering carbon neutrality within football.DiscussionThe study's findings underscore the viability of integrating AI-driven methodologies, specifically attention mechanisms and LSTM, to promote carbon neutrality within the football domain. The end-to-end architecture serves as a foundational platform for comprehensive carbon emission reduction, offering potential for broader application in other sectors. The combination of attention mechanisms and LSTM engenders deeper insights into carbon emissions' intricate temporal dynamics, informing the development of targeted strategies for emission mitigation. The study's outcomes provide theoretical underpinnings for advancing sustainable football practices and inspire the broader adoption of carbon neutrality principles across diverse domains.

AB Background While health care payers are increasingly considering approaches that help support stable and affordable housing for their beneficiaries, experience with these initiatives is limited. Through its 1115 HealthChoice waiver, Maryland Medicaid has begun experimenting with programs designed to pay for housing and tenancy support/case management services. This study investigates barriers and facilitators to the success of Maryland ' s pilot program initiative - Assistance in Community Integration Services (ACIS).
   Methods The study focused on key stakeholders employed by the four Lead Entities that currently participate in the ACIS program. The stakeholders included members of each Lead Entity ' s administration, direct service providers, state and local government officials, and case managers from local hospitals. The convenience sample was selected through an initial list of stakeholders and was supplemented using snowball sampling methods. Interviews were audio recorded and turned into transcripts via Otter.ai and then analyzed using NVivo by two independent reviewers.
   Results A total of 23 interviews were conducted between February 2022 and May 2022, representing a broad range of stakeholders across different Maryland geographies. A total of 4 themes were identified through the course of the interviews. Stakeholders identified difficulty finding housing for the target population in a tight housing market, challenges with communication within the program and with its clients, and problems with non-healthcare providers documenting services for reimbursement. At the same time, ACIS was seen as creating opportunities for organizations to work together across siloes in meeting client needs.
   Conclusions The findings of this study helps to highlight Medicaid 1115 waivers as a novel approach to using Medicaid funds to support tenancy-based services, such as ACIS and to improve the lives of individuals while reducing healthcare costs. Implementation of the ACIS program in Maryland has been a resounding success in helping individuals obtain and sustain stable housing. However, continued efforts to align capacity with demand, streamline billing and reimbursement and improve communication with clients and across partners will need to be prioritized.The program also highlights the growing need to address root causes of housing insecurity including the limited supply of affordable housing.

AB Besides its structural and economic characteristics, the location of a property is probably one of the most important determinants of its underlying value. In contrast to property valuations, there are hardly any approaches to date that evaluate the quality of a real estate location in an automated manner. The reasons are the complexity, the number of interactions and the non-linearities underlying the quality specifications of a certain location. By combining a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm and the local post-hoc model agnostic method of Shapley Additive Explanations, this paper introduces a newly developed approach - called SHAP location score - that is able to detect these complexities and enables assessing real estate locations in a data-based manner. The SHAP location score represents an intuitive and flexible approach based on econometric modeling techniques and the basic assumptions of hedonic pricing theory. The approach can be applied post-hoc to any common machine learning method and can be flexibly adapted to the respective needs. This constitutes a significant extension of traditional urban models and offers many advantages for a wide range of real estate players.

TI Counterfactual explanations for misclassified images: How human and

DE XAI; Counterfactual explanation; User testing
ID BLACK-BOX
AB Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular solution for the eXplainable AI (XAI) problem of elucidating the predictions of black-box deep-learning systems because people easily understand them, they apply across different problem domains and seem to be legally compliant. Although over 100 counterfactual methods exist in the XAI literature, each claiming to generate plausible explanations akin to those preferred by people, few of these methods have actually been tested on users (similar to 7%). Even fewer studies adopt a user-centered perspective; for instance, asking people for their counterfactual explanations to determine their perspective on a "good explanation". This gap in the literature is addressed here using a novel methodology that (i) gathers human-generated counterfactual explanations for misclassified images, in two user studies and, then, (ii) compares these human-generated explanations to computationally-generated explanations for the same misclassifications. Results indicate that humans do not "minimally edit" images when generating counterfactual explanations. Instead, they make larger, "meaningful" edits that better approximate prototypes in the counterfactual class. An analysis based on "explanation goals" is proposed to account for this divergence between human and machine explanations. The implications of these proposals for future work are discussed.

AB As 5G deployments continue to increase worldwide, new applications can fully leverage the exceptional features of the emerging mobile networks. Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) serve as an excellent example of applications highly sensitive to jitter and packet loss. To meet these demanding requirements, 5G relies on network slicing, network virtualization, and software-defined networks. This ecosystem enables the precise allocation of resources for each network slice. However, the applications' resource demands may vary over time. In this challenging and overwhelming environment, traditional human decision-making for slice reconfiguration is not suitable anymore, due to the multitude of parameters and the need for extremely fast response times. Machine Learning (ML) comes as a tool that can enable better use of the available resources with faster and more intelligent management. This paper introduces an ML model that can predict slices' traffic and dynamically reconfigure computational capacity. With these forecasting capabilities, the virtualized resources can be fine-tuned to suit the slices' requirements, guaranteeing their Quality of Service (QoS). By doing so, Mobile Network Operators can make optimized use of the equipment, tailoring their needs to each service while complying with the QoS level. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed ML model, in combination with a specific set of hysteresis rules, can accurately predict the saturation of virtualized capacity with up to 91% accuracy and proactively adapt it to the network slice requirements.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressively permeating medicine, notably in the realm of assisted diagnosis. However, the traditional unimodal AI models, reliant on large volumes of accurately labeled data and single data type usage, prove insufficient to assist dermatological diagnosis. Augmenting these models with text data from patient narratives, laboratory reports, and image data from skin lesions, dermoscopy, and pathologies could significantly enhance their diagnostic capacity. Large-scale pre-training multimodal models offer a promising solution, exploiting the burgeoning reservoir of clinical data and amalgamating various data types. This paper delves into unimodal models' methodologies, applications, and shortcomings while exploring how multimodal models can enhance accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, integrating cutting-edge technologies like federated learning and multi-party privacy computing with AI can substantially mitigate patient privacy concerns in dermatological datasets and further fosters a move towards high-precision self-diagnosis. Diagnostic systems underpinned by large-scale pre-training multimodal models can facilitate dermatology physicians in formulating effective diagnostic and treatment strategies and herald a transformative era in healthcare.

AB Background There are several models that predict the risk of recurrence following resection of localised, primary gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). However, assessment of calibration is not always feasible and when per-formed, calibration of current GIST models appears to be suboptimal. We aimed to develop a prognostic model to predict the recurrence of GIST after surgery with both good discrimination and calibration by uncovering and harnessing the non-linear relationships among variables that predict recurrence.Methods In this observational cohort study, the data of 395 adult patients who underwent complete resection (R0 or R1) of a localised, primary GIST in the preimatinib era at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NY, USA) (recruited 1982-2001) and a European consortium (Spanish Group for Research in Sarcomas, 80 sites) (recruited 1987-2011) were used to train an interpretable Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model called Optimal Classification Trees (OCT). The OCT predicted the probability of recurrence after surgery by capturing non-linear relationships among predictors of recurrence. The data of an additional 596 patients from another European consortium (Polish Clinical GIST Registry, 7 sites) (recruited 1981-2013) who were also treated in the preimatinib era were used to externally validate the OCT predictions with regard to discrimination (Harrell's C-index and Brier score) and calibration (calibration curve, Brier score, and Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The calibration of the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) GIST nomogram was used as a comparative gold standard. We also evaluated the clinical utility of the OCT and the MSK nomogram by performing a Decision Curve Analysis (DCA).

AB Background: Bioactive factors in functional foods play a crucial role in performing their specific functions. These factors have their own specific physical and chemical properties, and more importantly, they have specific interactions with other components in the food system to produce the desired functions. With the rapid development and integration of computer science, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and other related fields, datadriven quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has emerged as a crucial tool for all fields of food research. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review of the QSAR of natural non-peptidic foodrelated products. Scope and approach: We focus on recent advancements in the theories, current applications, and status of QSAR methods in food science and related fields. We summarize an overview of the emerging trends, future directions, and limitations of various methods, as well as explore the implications of QSAR methods in improving food quality, safety, and nutrition in the ever-evolving landscape of food science research. Key findings and conclusions: QSAR plays a significant role in predicting, discovering, designing, and screening of non-peptidic food-related natural products, and interpreting the functional mechanisms. In particular, the use of artificial intelligence-based methods is expected to drive new advancements in the application of QSAR methods.

ID ACCURACY
AB The increasing rates of breast cancer, particularly in emerging economies, have led to interest in scalable deep learning-based solutions that improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of mammographic screening. However, such tools require large volumes of high-quality training data, which can be challenging to obtain. This paper combines the experience of an AI startup with an analysis of the FAIR principles of the eight available datasets. It demonstrates that the datasets vary considerably, particularly in their interoperability, as each dataset is skewed towards a particular clinical use-case. Additionally, the mix of digital captures and scanned film compounds the problem of variability, along with differences in licensing terms, ease of access, labelling reliability, and file formats. Improving interoperability through adherence to standards such as the BIRADS criteria for labelling and annotation, and a consistent file format, could markedly improve access and use of larger amounts of standardized data. This, in turn, could be increased further by GAN-based synthetic data generation, paving the way towards better health outcomes for breast cancer.

AB Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific gamma 9 delta 2 T cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) protective against intracellular Mtb growth. However, GzmA-enzymatic activity is unnecessary for pathogen inhibition, and the mechanisms of GzmA-mediated protection remain unknown. We show that GzmA homodimerization is essential for opsonization of mycobacteria, altered uptake into human monocytes, and subsequent pathogen clearance within the phagolysosome. Although monomeric and homodimeric GzmA bind mycobacteria, only homodimers also bind cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Without access to surface-expressed CD14 and TLR4, GzmA fails to inhibit intracellular Mtb. Upregulation of Rab11FIP1 was associated with inhibitory activity. Furthermore, GzmA colocalized with and was regulated by protein disulfide isomerase AI (PDIA1), which cleaves GzmA homodimers into monomers and prevents Mtb inhibitory activity. These studies identify a previously unrecognized role for homodimeric GzmA structure in opsonization, phagocytosis, and elimination of Mtb in human monocytes, and they highlight PDIA1 as a potential host-directed therapy for prevention and treatment of tuberculosis, a major human disease.

AB Overview: Photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely used in residential applications in Poland and Europe due to increasing environmental concerns and fossil fuel energy prices. Energy management strategies for residential systems (1.2 million prosumer PV installations in Poland) play an important role in reducing energy bills and maximizing profits. Problem: This article aims to check how predictable the operation of a household PV system is in the short term-such predictions are usually made 24 h in advance. Methods: We made a comparative study of different energy management strategies based on a real household profile (selected energy storage installation) based on both traditional methods and various artificial intelligence (AI) tools, which is a new approach, so far rarely used and underutilized, and may inspire further research, including those based on the paradigm of Industry 4.0 and, increasingly, Industry 5.0. Results: This paper discusses the results for different operational scenarios, considering two prosumer billing systems in Poland (net metering and net billing). Conclusions: Insights into future research directions and their limitations due to legal status, etc., are presented. The novelty and contribution lies in the demonstration that, in the case of domestic PV grids, even simple AI solutions can prove effective in inference and forecasting to support energy flow management and make it more predictable and efficient.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Background Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in radiology. However, more and more often it is no longer possible to reconstruct decisions, especially in the case of new and powerful methods from the field of deep learning. The resulting models fulfill their function without the users being able to understand the internal processes and are used as so-called black boxes. Especially in sensitive areas such as medicine, the explainability of decisions is of paramount importance in order to verify their correctness and to be able to evaluate alternatives. For this reason, there is active research going on to elucidate these black boxes.
   Method This review paper presents different approaches for explainable artificial intelligence with their advantages and disadvantages. Examples are used to illustrate the introduced methods. This study is intended to enable the reader to better assess the limitations of the corresponding explanations when meeting them in practice and strengthen the integration of such solutions in new research projects.
   Results and Conclusion Besides methods to analyze black-box models for explainability, interpretable models offer an interesting alternative. Here, explainability is part of the process and the learned model knowledge can be verified with expert knowledge.

AB Industrial automation systems are undergoing a revolutionary change with the use of Internet-connected operating equipment and the adoption of cutting-edge advanced technology such as AI, IoT, cloud computing, and deep learning within business organizations. These innovative and additional solutions are facilitating Industry 4.0. However, the emergence of these technological advances and the quality solutions that they enable will also introduce unique security challenges whose consequence needs to be identified. This research presents a hybrid intrusion detection model (HIDM) that uses OCNN-LSTM and transfer learning (TL) for Industry 4.0. The proposed model utilizes an optimized CNN by using enhanced parameters of the CNN via the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) method, which fine-tunes the CNN parameters and helps to improve the model's prediction accuracy. The transfer learning model helps to train the model, and it transfers the knowledge to the OCNN-LSTM model. The TL method enhances the training process, acquiring the necessary knowledge from the OCNN-LSTM model and utilizing it in each next cycle, which helps to improve detection accuracy. To measure the performance of the proposed model, we conducted a multi-class classification analysis on various online industrial IDS datasets, i.e., ToN-IoT and UNW-NB15. We have conducted two experiments for these two datasets, and various performance-measuring parameters, i.e., precision, F-measure, recall, accuracy, and detection rate, were calculated for the OCNN-LSTM model with and without TL and also for the CNN and LSTM models. For the ToN-IoT dataset, the OCNN-LSTM with TL model achieved a precision of 92.7%; for the UNW-NB15 dataset, the precision was 94.25%, which is higher than OCNN-LSTM without TL.

AB The metaverse, as an impressive technology, can achieve outstanding performance in many fields. With the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), more and more metaverse artificial intelligence (AI) applications are emerging, which have low tolerance for delay. The edge computing based metaverse AI can overcome this problem. However, these AI applications bring new challenges of high reliability, especially DNNs are subject to the security risk of adversarial attacks that generate small and imperceptible noise and cause classifier to make predictions with a high error probability. To meet the reliability requirements of AI applications, in this paper, we propose a security mechanism against adversarial attacks in edge computing based metaverse AI applications. This mechanism utilizes a modified ResNet model that defends against adversarial attacks. We deploy it on the edge cloud to preprocess the data uploaded by metaverse AI applications. In order to achieve a better model performance, we use multiple residual network blocks to build this neural network model on the basis of autoencoder. To assist the model to produce defensively high-quality images, we utilize several convolution layers with various step sizes to process multi-scale images and design to use multiple types of samples with different properties together for the model training. We evaluate our method with experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, and against five attacks such as FGSM and DeepFool attacks. We show that our method achieves 96% defence success rate in MNIST and significantly outperforms existing denoising methods in terms of residual network block, multi-scale image, and training methods.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) generative models driven by the integration of AI and natural language processing technologies, such as OpenAI's chatbot generative pre-trained transformer large language model (LLM), are receiving much public attention and have the potential to transform personalized medicine. Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients' lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients' engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients' care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists' collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients' quality of life.

SO RADIOLOGY
LA English

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; ALGORITHM; CANCER; TRUST
AB Background: The factors affecting radiologists' diagnostic determinations in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted image reading remain underexplored. Purpose: To assess how AI diagnostic performance and reader characteristics influence detection of malignant lung nodules during AI-assisted reading of chest radiographs.
   Materials and Methods: This retrospective study consisted of two reading sessions from April 2021 to June 2021. Based on the first session without AI assistance, 30 readers were assigned into two groups with equivalent areas under the free-response receiver operating characteristic curve (AUFROCs). In the second session, each group reinterpreted radiographs assisted by either a high or low accuracy AI model (blinded to the fact that two different AI models were used). Reader performance for detecting lung cancer and reader susceptibility (changing the original reading following the AI suggestion) were compared. A generalized linear mixed model was used to identify the factors influencing AI-assisted detection performance, including readers' attitudes and experiences of AI and Grit score.
   Results: Of the 120 chest radiographs assessed, 60 were obtained in patients with lung cancer (mean age, 67 years +/- 12 [SD]; 32 male; 63 cancers) and 60 in controls (mean age, 67 years +/- 12; 36 male). Readers included 20 thoracic radiologists (5-18 years of experience) and 10 radiology residents (2-3 years of experience). Use of the high accuracy AI model improved readers' detection performance to a greater extent than use of the low accuracy AI model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 to 0.82 vs 0.75 to 0.75; AUFROC, 0.71 to 0.79 vs 0.7 to 0.72). Readers who used the high accuracy AI showed a higher susceptibility (67%, 224 of 334 cases) to changing their diagnosis based on the AI suggestions than those using the low accuracy AI (59%, 229 of 386 cases). Accurate readings at the first session, correct AI suggestions, high accuracy Al, and diagnostic difficulty were associated with accurate AI-assisted readings, but readers' characteristics were not.
   Conclusion: An AI model with high diagnostic accuracy led to improved performance of radiologists in detecting lung cancer on chest radiographs and increased radiologists' susceptibility to AI suggestions.

TI AI-based CT Body Composition Identifies Myosteatosis as Key Mortality
   Predictor in Asymptomatic Adults
SO RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LIVER; OUTCOMES; OBESITY; MASS; FAT
AB Background: Body composition data have been limited to adults with disease or older age. The prognostic impact in otherwise asymptomatic adults is unclear.
   Purpose: To use artificial intelligence-based body composition metrics from routine abdominal CT scans in asymptomatic adults to clarify the association between obesity, liver steatosis, myopenia, and myosteatosis and the risk of mortality.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, consecutive adult outpatients undergoing routine colorectal cancer screening from April 2004 to December 2016 were included. Using a U-Net algorithm, the following body composition metrics were extracted from low-dose, noncontrast, supine multidetector abdominal CT scans: total muscle area, muscle density, subcutaneous and visceral fat area, and volumetric liver density. Abnormal body composition was defined by the presence of liver steatosis, obesity, muscle fatty infiltration (myosteatosis), and/or low muscle mass (myopenia). The incidence of death and major adverse cardiovascular events were recorded during a median follow-up of 8.8 years. Multivariable analyses were performed accounting for age, sex, smoking status, myosteatosis, liver steatosis, myopenia, type 2 diabetes, obesity, visceral fat, and history of cardiovascular events.
   Results: Overall, 8982 consecutive outpatients (mean age, 57 years +/- 8 [SD]; 5008 female, 3974 male) were included. Abnormal body composition was found in 86% (434 of 507) of patients who died during follow-up. Myosteatosis was found in 278 of 507 patients (55%) who died (15.5% absolute risk at 10 years). Myosteatosis, obesity, liver steatosis, and myopenia were associated with increased mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.33 [95% CI: 3.63, 5.16], 1.27 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.53], 1.86 [95% CI: 1.56, 2.21], and 1.75 [95% CI: 1.43, 2.14], respectively). In 8303 patients (excluding 679 patients without complete data), after multivariable adjustment, myosteatosis remained associated with increased mortality risk (HR, 1.89 [95% CI: 1.52, 2.35]; P <.001).
   Conclusion: Artificial intelligence-based profiling of body composition from routine abdominal CT scans identified myosteatosis as a key predictor of mortality risk in asymptomatic adults.

TI Opportunistic Screening: <i>Radiology</i> Scientific Expert Panel
SO RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY SCANS; CT COLONOGRAPHY; OSTEOPOROSIS; BIOMARKERS;
   CANCER
AB Radiologic tests often contain rich imaging data not relevant to the clinical indication. Opportunistic screening refers to the practice of systematically leveraging these incidental imaging findings. Although opportunistic screening can apply to imaging modalities such as conventional radiography, US, and MRI, most attention to date has focused on body CT by using artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted methods. Body CT represents an ideal high-volume modality whereby a quantitative assessment of tissue composition (eg, bone, muscle, fat, and vascular calcium) can provide valuable risk stratification and help detect unsuspected presymptomatic disease. The emergence of "explainable" AI algorithms that fully automate these measurements could eventually lead to their routine clinical use. Potential barriers to widespread implementation of opportunistic CT screening include the need for buy-in from radiologists, referring providers, and patients. Standardization of acquiring and reporting measures is needed, in addition to expanded normative data according to age, sex, and race and ethnicity. Regulatory and reimbursement hurdles are not insurmountable but pose substantial challenges to commercialization and clinical use. Through demonstration of improved population health outcomes and cost-effectiveness, these opportunistic CT-based measures should be attractive to both payers and health care systems as value-based reimbursement models mature. If highly successful, opportunistic screening could eventually justify a practice of standalone "intended" CT screening.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) models have improved US assessment of thyroid nodules; however, the lack of generalizability limits the application of these models.
   Purpose: To develop AI models for segmentation and classification of thyroid nodules in US using diverse data sets from nationwide hospitals and multiple vendors, and to measure the impact of the AI models on diagnostic performance.
   Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed thyroid nodules who underwent US using equipment from 12 vendors at 208 hospitals across China from November 2017 to January 2019. The detection, segmentation, and classification models were developed based on the subset or complete set of images. Model performance was evaluated by precision and recall, Dice coefficient, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analyses. Three scenarios (diagnosis without AI assistance, with freestyle AI assistance, and with rule-based AI assistance) were compared with three senior and three junior radiologists to optimize incorporation of AI into clinical practice.
   Results: A total of 10 023 patients (median age, 46 years [IQR 37-55 years]; 7669 female) were included. The detection, segmentation, and classification models had an average precision, Dice coefficient, and AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96, 0.99), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.87), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.92), respectively. The segmentation model trained on the nationwide data and classification model trained on the mixed vendor data exhibited the best performance, with a Dice coefficient of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.91) and AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), respectively. The AI model outperformed all senior and junior radiologists (P <.05 for all comparisons), and the diagnostic accuracies of all radiologists were improved (P <.05 for all comparisons) with rule-based AI assistance.
   Conclusion: Thyroid US AI models developed from diverse data sets had high diagnostic performance among the Chinese population. Rule-based AI assistance improved the performance of radiologists in thyroid cancer diagnosis.

ID COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; PERFORMANCE
AB Background: There is considerable interest in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in mammographic screening. However, it is essential to critically evaluate the performance of AI before it can become a modality used for independent mammographic interpretation.
   Purpose: To evaluate the reported standalone performances of AI for interpretation of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT).
   Materials and Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published from January 2017 to June 2022. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were reviewed. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Comparative (QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C, respectively). A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed for overall studies and for different study types (reader studies vs historic cohort studies) and imaging techniques (digital mammography vs DBT). Results: In total, 16 studies that include 1 108 328 examinations in 497 091 women were analyzed (six reader studies, seven historic cohort studies on digital mammography, and four studies on DBT). Pooled AUCs were significantly higher for standalone AI than radiologists in the six reader studies on digital mammography (0.87 vs 0.81, P =.002), but not for historic cohort studies (0.89 vs 0.96, P =.152). Four studies on DBT showed significantly higher AUCs in AI compared with radiologists (0.90 vs 0.79, P <.001). Higher sensitivity and lower specificity were seen for standalone AI compared with radiologists.
   Conclusion: Standalone AI for screening digital mammography performed as well as or better than radiologists. Compared with digital mammography, there is an insufficient number of studies to assess the performance of AI systems in the interpretation of DBT screening examinations.

DT Review

AB Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has increasingly been utilized in patients with aortic insufficiency (AI) with insufficient data on its safety. The Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) was queried to identify patients undergoing TAVI for AI. Net clinical events (composite of in-hospital mor-tality, stroke, major bleeding) and procedural compli-cations were assessed using a propensity-score matched (PSM) analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR). A total of 185,703 (AI 3873, aortic stenosis [AS] 181,830) patients were included in the analysis. Due to a significant difference in the baseline charac-teristics, a matched sample of 7929 patients (AI 3873, AS 4056) was selected. At index admission, the adjusted odds of in-hospital NACE (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.59-2.51), mortality (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 2.38-5.47), major bleeding (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.06) and val-vular complications (aOR 9.48, 95% CI 6.73-13.38) were significantly higher in patients undergoing TAVI for AI compared with those undergoing TAVI for AS. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of NACE, mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and need for permanent pacemaker implantation at 30-and 180-days follow-up. TAVI in AI was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural NACE, mortality, and major bleeding. The risk of these complications attenuated at 30-and 180-day readmission.

AB The adoption of digital technologies (DTs) has become a predominant management practice in recent years. However, empirical findings on their performance outcomes are mixed and fragmented across cultures, contexts, and disciplines. Inspired by the resource-based view of the firm, resource orchestration theory, and contingency theory, this study aims to examine the extent to which four selected DTs-artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics (BDAs), internet of things/cyber-physical system (IoT/CPS), and 3D printings (3DP)-impact the overall, financial, innovation, and operational performance of the firm through a meta-analysis. Employing a random-effects model and psychometric meta-analysis approach based on subgroup and meta-regression analyses, we examine 109 studies with 1,346,242 observations and 165 effect sizes from 2006 to 2021. The findings reveal that DTs have a positive and moderate effect on overall firm performance; however, the impact on innovation performance is the largest, followed by operational efficiency, and finally, financial performance. Moreover, the results show that the impact of AI on firm performance is the largest, while 3DP exerts the lowest impact. Furthermore, boundary-spanning conditions-contextual factors (i.e., firm size, firm age, sector, country development, sector technology intensity, time frame) and methodological factors (i.e., study type, sampling technique, type of performance measure)-moderate the focal relationship (i.e., account for between-study variance). The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are highlighted.

AB Microcystis aeruginosa, the dominant species causing cyanobacterial blooms, poses a serious threat to water environment security and development of aquaculture. The physiological stress in aquatic animals after exposure to M. aeruginosa has been extensively studied, however, the impacts on the physiological stress of aquatic animals in the process of controlling M. aeruginosa blooms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of quorum sensing autoinducer 2 (AI-2) on the algicidal activity of Deinococcus sp. Y35, and determined the effect of strain Y35 together with AI-2 on the physiological stress caused by M. aeruginosa to zebrafish. The results demonstrated that the synthesized AI-2 in vitro based on proteins MtnN and LuxS of strain Y35 could significantly promote the synthesis of algicidal pigment and improve the algicidal activity of strain Y35. The M. aeruginosa exposure could seriously damage the intestinal structure integrity of zebrafish, inducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, as well as significant up-regulation of proinflammatory genes expression level. The separate application of strain Y35 could alleviate the physiological stress caused by M. aeruginosa including the protection of intestinal tissue, reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, as well as inhibition of proinflammatory genes expression. Meanwhile, the addition of synthesized AI-2 could significantly increase the alleviation effect of strain Y35 on the physiological stress. These results indicate that algicidal bacteria like Deinococcus sp. Y35 can play an important role in alleviating physiological stress of aquatic organisms and can be regarded as a potential resource for controlling cyanobacterial blooms and protecting aquatic organisms.

AB Recently, deep learning has proven to be a successful technique especially in medical image analysis. This paper aims to highlight the importance of deep learning architectures in lung disease diagnosis using CXR images. Related articles were identified through searches of electronic resources, including IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, PubMed, Nature and, Hindawi digital library. The inclusion of articles was based on high-performance artificial intelligence models, developed for the classification of possible findings in CXR images published from 2018 to 2023.After the quality assessment of papers, 129 articles were included according to PRISMA guidelines. Papers were studied by types of lung disease, data source, algorithm type, and outcome metrics. Three main categories of computer-aided lung disease detection were covered: traditional machine learning, deep learning-based methods, and combination of aforementioned methods for all lung diseases.The results showed that various pre-trained networks including ResNet, VGG, and DenseNet, are the most frequently used CNN architectures and would result in a notable increase in sensitivity and accuracy. Recent research suggests that utilizing a combination of deep networks with a robust machine learning classifier can outperform deep learning approaches that rely solely on fully connected neural networks as their classifier. Finally, the limitations of the existing literature and potential future research opportunities in possible findings in CXR images using deep learning architectures are discussed in this systematic review.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The stability evaluation of deep foundation pit slopes is crucial, including the solution of the factor of safety and the location of the critical slip surface. Prestressed anchor cables and underground diaphragm walls are commonly used to reinforce pit slopes. By means of the dimensional increase technique and the global analysis approach of slope stability, a nonlinear optimization problem is defined for the stability analysis of pit slopes. In the optimization problem, the ordinates of discrete points on the slip surface and the factor of safety are both the decision variables, the objective function is the factor of security, and the constraints are the equilibrium equations and the convexity of the slip surface. Because the objective function is linear and the constraint functions are polynomials of degree three at most, the optimization problem is a classical optimization one that conventional optimization techniques can solve without recourse to modern optimization techniques such as the AI technique. Examples suggest that the proposed procedure is far more efficient and stable than the optimization models based on the methods of slides. At last, applications are demonstrated to ongoing deep foundation pit slopes situated at Tong Zhou - Beijing sub-center.

AB PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing product recommendations, but little is known about consumer acceptance of AI recommendations. This study examines how to improve consumers' acceptance of AI recommendations from the perspective of product type (material vs experiential).Design/methodology/approachFour studies, including a field experiment and three online experiments, tested how consumers' preference for AI-based (vs human) recommendations differs between material and experiential product purchases.FindingsResults show that people perceive AI recommendations as more competent than human recommendations for material products, whereas they believe human recommendations are more competent than AI recommendations for experiential products. Therefore, people are more (less) likely to choose AI recommendations when buying material (vs experiential) products. However, this effect is eliminated when is used as an assistant to rather than a replacement for a human recommendation.Originality/valueThis study is the first to focus on how products' material and experiential attributes influence people's attitudes toward AI recommendations. The authors also identify under what circumstances resistance to algorithmic advice is attenuated. These findings contribute to the research on the psychology of artificial intelligence and on human-technology interaction by investigating how experiential and material attributes influence preference for or resistance to AI recommenders.

AB IntroductionA greater understanding of Australian healthcare professionals' perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) is needed to identify the challenges ahead as this new technology finds its way into healthcare delivery.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to identify healthcare professionals' perceptions of AI, their understanding of this technology, their education needs and barriers they perceived to its implementation.DesignHealthcare professionals in eight local health districts in New South Wales Australia were surveyed using the Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception (SHAIP) tool.FindingsThe study surveyed 176 participants from regional (59.5%), rural (36.4%) and metropolitan (4.0%) healthcare districts in Australia. Only 27% of all participants stated they are currently using AI in the delivery of care. The study found that Age, Discipline, Use of AI and Desire for Education had a significant effect on perceptions of AI, and that overall healthcare professionals believe AI will impact their role and they do not feel prepared for its use. The study showed that understanding of AI is varied and workforce knowledge is seen as the greatest barrier to implementation. More than 75% of healthcare professionals desire education about AI, its application and ethical implications to the delivery of care.ConclusionThe development of education is needed urgently to prepare healthcare professionals for the implementation of AI.

AB Developing Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) is a crucial step during process development. We propose a data-driven method for the prediction of control structures. Our methodology is inspired by end-to-end transformer-based human language translation models. We cast the control structure prediction as a translation task where Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) without control structures are translated to PFDs with control structures. We represent the topology of PFDs as strings using the SFILES 2.0 notation. We pretrain our model using generated PFDs to learn the grammatical structure. Thereafter, the model is fine-tuned leveraging transfer learning on real PFDs. The model achieved a top-5 accuracy of 74.8% on 10,000 generated PFDs and 89.2% on 100,000 generated PFDs. These promising results show great potential for AI-assisted process engineering. The tests on a dataset of 312 real PFDs indicate the need for a larger PFD dataset for industry applications and hybrid artificial intelligence solutions.

AB Fear of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a predominant term in users' perceptions of emerging AI technologies. Yet we have limited knowledge about how end users perceive different types of fear of AI (e.g., fear of artificial consciousness, fear of job replacement) and what affordances of AI technologies may induce such fears. We conducted a survey (N = 717) and found that while synchronicity generally helps reduce all types of fear of AI, perceived AI control increases all types of AI fear. We also found that perceived bandwidth was positively associated with fear of artificial consciousness, but negatively associated with fear of learning about AI, among other findings. Our study provides theoretical implications by adopting a multi-dimensional fear of AI framework and analyzing the unique effects of perceived affordances of AI applications on each type of fear. We also provide practical suggestions on how fear of AI might be reduced via user experience design.

AB IntroductionDigital pathology artificial intelligence (AI) platforms have the capacity to improve over time through "deep machine learning." We have previously reported on the accuracy of peripheral white blood cell (WBC) differential and blast identification by Techcyte (Techcyte, Inc., Orem, UT, USA), a digital scanner-agnostic web-based system for blood film reporting. The aim of the current study was to compare AI protocols released over time to assess improvement in cell identification.MethodsWBC differentials were performed using Techcyte's online AI software on the same 124 digitized abnormal peripheral blood films (including 64 acute and 22 chronic leukaemias) in 2019 (AI1), 2020 (AI2), and 2022 (AI3), with no reassignment by a morphologist at any time point. AI results were correlated to the "gold standard" of manual microscopy, and comparison of Lin's concordance coefficients (LCC) and sensitivity and specificity of blast identification were used to determine the superior AI version.ResultsAI correlations (r) with manual microscopy for individual cell types ranged from 0.50-0.90 (AI1), 0.66-0.86 (AI2) and 0.71-0.91 (AI3). AI3 concordance with manual microscopy was significantly improved compared to AI1 for identification of neutrophils (LCC AI3 = 0.86 vs. AI1 = 0.77, p = 0.03), total granulocytes (LCC AI3 = 0.92 vs. AI1 = 0.82, p = 0.0008), immature granulocytes (LCC AI3 = 0.67 vs. AI1 = 0.38, p = 0.0014), and promyelocytes (LCC AI3 = 0.53 vs. AI1 = 0.16, p = 0.0008). Sensitivity for blast identification (n = 65 slides) improved from 97% (AI1), to 98% (AI2), to 100% (AI3), while blast specificity decreased from 24% (AI1), to 14% (AI2) to 12% (AI3).ConclusionTechcyte AI has shown significant improvement in cell identification over time and maintains high sensitivity for blast identification in malignant films.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global healthcare systems and highlighted the need for innovative, technology-driven solutions like Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, previous research on the topic has been limited and fragmented, leading to an incomplete understanding of the 'what', 'where' and 'how' of its application, as well as its associated benefits and challenges. This study proposes a comprehensive AI framework for healthcare and assesses its effectiveness within the UAE's healthcare sector. It provides valuable insights into AI applications for healthcare stakeholders that range from the molecular to the population level. The study covers the different computational techniques employed, from machine learning to computer vision, and the various types of data inputs fed into these techniques, including clinical, epidemiological, locational, behavioural and genomic data. Additionally, the research highlights AI's capacity to enhance healthcare's operational, quality-related and social outcomes, and recognises regulatory policies, technological infrastructure, stakeholder cooperation and innovation readiness as key facilitators of AI adoption. Lastly, we stress the importance of addressing challenges such as data privacy, security, generalisability and algorithmic bias. Our findings are relevant beyond the pandemic in facilitating the development of AI-related policy interventions and support mechanisms for building resilient healthcare sector that can withstand future challenges.

AB As conversational agents powered by large language models become more human-like, users are starting to view them as companions rather than mere assistants. Our study explores how changes to a person's mental model of an AI system affects their interaction with the system. Participants interacted with the same conversational AI, but were influenced by different priming statements regarding the AI's inner motives: caring, manipulative or no motives. Here we show that those who perceived a caring motive for the AI also perceived it as more trustworthy, empathetic and better-performing, and that the effects of priming and initial mental models were stronger for a more sophisticated AI model. Our work also indicates a feedback loop in which the user and AI reinforce the user's mental model over a short time; further work should investigate long-term effects. The research highlights the importance of how AI systems are introduced can notably affect the interaction and how the AI is experienced.
   The recent accessibility of large language models brought them into contact with a large number of users and, due to the social nature of language, it is hard to avoid prescribing human characteristics such as intentions to a chatbot. Pataranutaporn and colleagues investigated how framing a bot as helpful or manipulative can influence this perception and the behaviour of the humans that interact with it.

AB Although there is no solid agreement for artificial intelligence (AI), it refers to a computer system with intelligence similar to that of humans. Deep learning appeared in 2006, and more than 10 years have passed since the third AI boom was triggered by improvements in computing power, algorithm development, and the use of big data. In recent years, the application and development of AI technology in the medical field have intensified internationally. There is no doubt that AI will be used in clinical practice to assist in diagnostic imaging in the future. In qualitative diagnosis, it is desirable to develop an explainable AI that at least represents the basis of the diagnostic process. However, it must be kept in mind that AI is a physician-assistant system, and the final decision should be made by the physician while understanding the limitations of AI. The aim of this article is to review the application of AI technology in diagnostic imaging from PubMed database while particularly focusing on diagnostic imaging in thorax such as lesion detection and qualitative diagnosis in order to help radiologists and clinicians to become more familiar with AI in thorax.

AB Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of administering 300 IU hCG intravaginally (i.vag.) at the time of artificial insemination (AI) on ovulatory response, luteal function and pregnancy rates in cyclic Alpine (A) and Saanen (S) goats. All animals received two i.m. injections of 37.5 mu g of D-cloprostenol (Prolise (R); Tecnopec, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) at 11.5-day (Experiments 1 and 2) or 7.5-day intervals (Experiment 2). One day after the onset of estrus (day of AI=D0), the goats were randomly allocated to one of the two groups that received: 300 IU hCG (Vetecor (R); Hertape-Calier, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) i.vag. (G-hCG; Experiment 1: n = 12 A; Experiment 2: n = 80 A + 63 S) or 0.3 mL or saline solution i.vag. (G-Control; Experiment 1: n = 12 A; Experiment 2: n = 82 A + 65 S). Blood samples for measurements of circulating progesterone concentrations were drawn on both days of D-cloprostenol injections and on D3, D7, D10, D13 and D21 (Experiment 1). Transrectal ovarian ultrasonography was done on D7, D10, D13, D17 and D21 (Experiment 1), and pregnancy detection was performed on D60 (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in the mean diameter of ovulatory follicles, timing and number of ovulations, and incidence of early luteal regression between the two groups of goats. However, the total luteal area on D17 and D21 and luteal vascularization on D10 and D13 were higher (P < 0.05) in G-hCG compared with G-Control does. In Experiment 2, the pregnancy rate was higher (P < 0.05) in G-hCG compared with G-Control goats (80.4% compared with 67.3%, respectively). Human chorionic gonadotropin (300 IU) given i.vag. at the time of AI did not alter ovulatory response or progesterone secretory ability of resultant corpora lutea nor did it completely prevent premature luteal regression, but it increased the luteal area and luteal vascularization as well as the conception rate in dairy goats (the latter by 13.1%).

TI Deep representation learning identifies associations between physical
   activity and sleep patterns during pregnancy and prematurity
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of infant mortality globally. Research has focused on developing predictive models for PTB without prioritizing cost-effective interventions. Physical activity and sleep present unique opportunities for interventions in low- and middle-income populations (LMICs). However, objective measurement of physical activity and sleep remains challenging and self-reported metrics suffer from low-resolution and accuracy. In this study, we use physical activity data collected using a wearable device comprising over 181,944 h of data across N = 1083 patients. Using a new state-of-the art deep learning time-series classification architecture, we develop a 'clock' of healthy dynamics during pregnancy by using gestational age (GA) as a surrogate for progression of pregnancy. We also develop novel interpretability algorithms that integrate unsupervised clustering, model error analysis, feature attribution, and automated actigraphy analysis, allowing for model interpretation with respect to sleep, activity, and clinical variables. Our model performs significantly better than 7 other machine learning and AI methods for modeling the progression of pregnancy. We found that deviations from a normal 'clock' of physical activity and sleep changes during pregnancy are strongly associated with pregnancy outcomes. When our model underestimates GA, there are 0.52 fewer preterm births than expected (P = 1.01e - 67, permutation test) and when our model overestimates GA, there are 1.44 times (P = 2.82e - 39, permutation test) more preterm births than expected. Model error is negatively correlated with interdaily stability (P = 0.043, Spearman's), indicating that our model assigns a more advanced GA when an individual's daily rhythms are less precise. Supporting this, our model attributes higher importance to sleep periods in predicting higher-than-actual GA, relative to lower-than-actual GA (P = 1.01e - 21, Mann-Whitney U). Combining prediction and interpretability allows us to signal when activity behaviors alter the likelihood of preterm birth and advocates for the development of clinical decision support through passive monitoring and exercise habit and sleep recommendations, which can be easily implemented in LMICs.

AB BACKGROUND: To investigate the predictive ability of high-throughput MRI with deep survival networks for biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PCa) after prostatectomy.METHODS: Clinical-MRI and histopathologic data of 579 (train/test, 463/116) PCa patients were retrospectively collected. The deep survival network (iBCR-Net) is based on stepwise processing operations, which first built an MRI radiomics signature (RadS) for BCR, and predicted the T3 stage and lymph node metastasis (LN+) of tumour using two predefined AI models. Subsequently, clinical, imaging and histopathological variables were integrated into iBCR-Net for BCR prediction.RESULTS: RadS, derived from 2554 MRI features, was identified as an independent predictor of BCR. Two predefined AI models achieved an accuracy of 82.6% and 78.4% in staging T3 and LN+. The iBCR-Net, when expressed as a presurgical model by integrating RadS, AI-diagnosed T3 stage and PSA, can match a state-of-the-art histopathological model (C-index, 0.81 to 0.83 vs 0.79 to 0.81, p > 0.05); and has maximally 5.16-fold, 12.8-fold, and 2.09-fold (p < 0.05) benefit to conventional D'Amico score, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score and the CAPRA Postsurgical score.CONCLUSIONS: AI-aided iBCR-Net using high-throughput MRI can predict PCa BCR accurately and thus may provide an alternative to the conventional method for PCa risk stratification.

AB Process automation and mass customisation requirements of modern manufacturing systems are driven by artificial intelligence (AI). As AI derives decisions from data, securing the data against tampering is crucial to prevent ensuing operational risks. Additionally, manufacturing systems necessitate collaboration, transparency, and trust among participants while preserving a competitive advantage. Thus, we position blockchain, an enabler of transparent and secure operations, as a security solution for AI-assisted manufacturing systems. In this conceptual viewpoint paper, we present a framework to integrate blockchain in AI-assisted manufacturing systems. We highlight the special needs of manufacturing BCs over generic BCs. We delineate the ways in which manufacturing can be a beneficiary of the synergy between AI and BC. We discuss how BC and AI can accelerate early-phase product design, collaboration, and manufacturing processes and secure supply chains against counterfeit products and for ethical consumerism. Lastly, we identify the needs of modern manufacturing systems and cite a few examples of organisational failures to underscore the importance of security while delineating the significant challenges in adopting blockchain-based solutions in the manufacturing industry.

AB The adoption of digital technologies in healthcare, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, requires a well-prepared workforce capable of implementing those technologies. Here, we examine the role and impact of digital fellowships in facilitating digital transformation in healthcare systems. Digital fellowships are structured educational programmes designed to equip healthcare professionals with advanced digital skills. Focusing on UK-based initiatives like the Topol Digital Fellowship and the Fellowship in Clinical AI, we explore their efforts to prepare healthcare leaders for digital and AI adoption. Each fellowship programme provides participants with hands-on experience in digital healthcare projects and fosters interdisciplinary collaboration and post-fellowship support. We discuss how these fellowships contribute to staff retention by diversifying professional experiences and opportunities. We call for increased collaborations between universities, industry, and professional bodies to integrate lessons from digital fellowships into relevant curricula, acknowledging that digital fellowships are just one piece of the puzzle in bridging the digital skills gap in the healthcare workforce.

AB BackgroundThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in dentistry has the potential to revolutionise the field of dental technologies. However, dental technicians' views on the use of AI in dental technology are still sparse in the literature. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perceptions of dental technicians regarding the use of AI in their dental laboratory practice.MethodsTwelve dental technicians with at least five years of professional experience and currently working in Malaysia agreed to participate in the one-to-one in-depth online interviews. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns, themes, and categories within the interview transcripts.ResultsThe analysis revealed two key themes: "Perceived Benefits of AI" and "Concerns and Challenges". Dental technicians recognised the enhanced efficiency, productivity, accuracy, and precision that AI can bring to dental laboratories. They also acknowledged the streamlined workflow and improved communication facilitated by AI systems. However, concerns were raised regarding job security, professional identity, ethical considerations, and the need for adequate training and support.ConclusionThis research sheds light on the potential benefits and challenges associated with the integration of AI in dental laboratory practices. Understanding these perceptions and addressing the challenges can support the effective integration of AI in dental laboratories and contribute to the growing body of literature on AI in healthcare.

The system aims to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of design processes by leveraging the complementary strengths of GA and PSO. This integration has propelled product design into accelerated evolution and modernization. The study delves into AI's application of deep neural networks in product design within the context of the digital age. Artificial intelligence technology is used in product design in the context of the Internet. First, the concept of AI technology is briefly introduced, and DNN algorithms are described in detail, including the PSO and Genetic Algorithms. Second, the product design and development process based on artificial intelligence technology, design guidelines, and technical features are mainly described. Finally, using the seat as the research object, the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in product design is analyzed, and 10 subjective evaluation questions are set to experiment. Regarding material texture, the highest score for the B3 Barcelona chair is 4.3. Users prefer leather seats with diverse materials, and the score for painted wood materials is lower. From the product structure and shape analysis, the highest score is the B3 Barcelona chair, which has a value of 4.1, and the lowest score is the B1 red and blue chair, which has a value of 3.0. Based on this result, users like arc and curve shape much more than straight structures.

AB BackgroundPrevalence of dementia illness, causing certain morbidity and mortality globally, places burden on global public health. This study primary goal was to assess future risks of dying from severe dementia, given specific return period, within selected group of regions or nations.MethodsTraditional statistical approaches do not have benefits of effectively handling large regional dimensionality, along with nonlinear cross-correlations between various regional observations. In order to produce reliable long-term projections of excessive dementia death rate risks, this study advocates novel bio-system reliability technique, that being particularly suited for multi-regional environmental, biological, and health systems.DataRaw clinical data has been used as an input to the suggested population-based, bio-statistical technique using data from medical surveys and several centers.ResultsNovel spatiotemporal health system reliability methodology has been developed and applied to dementia death rates raw clinical data. Suggested methodology shown to be capable of dealing efficiently with spatiotemporal clinical observations of multi-regional nature. Accurate disease risks multi-regional spatiotemporal prediction being done, relevant confidence intervals have been presented as well.ConclusionsBased on available clinical survey dataset, the proposed approach may be applied in a variety of clinical public health applications. Confidence bands, given for predicted dementia-associated death rate levels with return periods of interest, have been reasonably narrow, indicating practical values of advocated prognostics.

AB Purpose - Based on appraisal theory and social response theory, this study aims to explore the mechanism of AI failure types on consumer recovery expectation from the perspective of service failure assessment and validate the moderate role of anthropomorphism level.
   Design/methodology/approach - Three scenario-based experiments were conducted to validate the research model. First, to test the effect of robot service failure types on customer recovery expectation; second, to further test the mediating role of perceived controllability, perceived stability and perceived severity; finally, to verify the moderating effect of anthropomorphic level.
   Findings - Non-functional failures reduce consumer recovery expectation compared to functional failures; perceived controllability and perceived severity play a mediating role in the impact of service failure types on recovery expectation; the influence of service failure types on perceived controllability and perceived severity is moderated by the anthropomorphism level.
   Originality/value - The findings enrich the influence mechanism and boundary conditions of service failure types, and have implications for online enterprise follow-up service recovery and improvement of anthropomorphic design.

AB This study compares four data-driven methods, Gaussian process regression (GPR), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 model tree (M5Tree), and multilinear regression (MLR), in estimating mean velocity upstream and downstream of bridges. Data were obtained through multiple experiments in a rectangular laboratory flume with glass walls 9.5 m long, 0.6 m wide, and 0.6 m deep. Four different bridge models were placed at the 6th meter of the channel to determine the average velocities upstream and downstream. Different data-driven models were implemented with different combinations of effective parameters as input. They were evaluated and compared using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results showed that the MARS had the best efficiency in estimating the mean velocity upstream of the bridge model. At the same time, the M5Tree provided the highest performance in estimating the mean velocity downstream. The MARS method improved the estimation accuracy of GPR, M5Tree, and MLR in the test phase by 23.8%, 45.1%, and 47.4% concerning the RMSE at the upstream. The M5Tree provided better RMSE accuracy of 31.8%, 70.4%, and 75.5% at the downstream compared to MARS, GPR, and MLR, respectively. The study recommends the MARS and M5Tree for estimating mean velocities upstream and downstream of the bridge.

AB PurposeThe primary objective of this study was to develop and validate an AI algorithm as a screening tool for the detection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).ParticipantsImages were collected from infants enrolled in the KIDROP tele-ROP screening program.MethodsWe developed a deep learning (DL) algorithm with 227,326 wide-field images from multiple camera systems obtained from the KIDROP tele-ROP screening program in India over an 11-year period. 37,477 temporal retina images were utilized with the dataset split into train (n = 25,982, 69.33%), validation (n = 4,006, 10.69%), and an independent test set (n = 7,489, 19.98%). The algorithm consists of a binary classifier that distinguishes between the presence of ROP (Stages 1-3) and the absence of ROP. The image labels were retrieved from the daily registers of the tele-ROP program. They consist of per-eye diagnoses provided by trained ROP graders based on all images captured during the screening session. Infants requiring treatment and a proportion of those not requiring urgent referral had an additional confirmatory diagnosis from an ROP specialist.ResultsOf the 7,489 temporal images analyzed in the test set, 2,249 (30.0%) images showed the presence of ROP. The sensitivity and specificity to detect ROP was 91.46% (95% CI: 90.23%-92.59%) and 91.22% (95% CI: 90.42%-91.97%), respectively, while the positive predictive value (PPV) was 81.72% (95% CI: 80.37%-83.00%), negative predictive value (NPV) was 96.14% (95% CI: 95.60%-96.61%) and the AUROC was 0.970.ConclusionThe novel ROP screening algorithm demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in detecting the presence of ROP. A prospective clinical validation in a real-world tele-ROP platform is under consideration. It has the potential to lower the number of screening sessions required to be conducted by a specialist for a high-risk preterm infant thus significantly improving workflow efficiency.

AB The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are providing new tools to clinicians. AI tools have the potential to process vast amounts of data in a short amount of time, providing new insights and changing how we approach complicated healthcare problems. AI has the potential to assist clinicians in medical decision-making capacity assessments by providing additional insights to an evaluation process that currently lacks universal objective standards. However, despite the promise of AI in this setting, there remain significant concerns making it unlikely to replace human evaluators anytime soon. AI remains highly susceptible to biased inputs and thus biased decisions, raises questions about autonomy, and creates uncertainty for who is accountable for the ultimate decision of capacity. In this paper we explore these ethical considerations of using AI for capacity assessments. While we acknowledge AI may not be ready to replace physicians in determining patient medical-decision making capacity, these new technologies have significant near-term potential as a tool to screen patients, uncover physician biases, and guide next steps after a capacity determination has been made.

ID LEARNING APPROACH; SEGMENTATION; EVOLUTION
AB Traditional metallographic characterization of steel microstructure can only roughly determine average grain size and phase fractions because it relies too much on researchers' personal experiences. As a result, when the microstructure-property relationships are to be established, only the rough microstructural features can be taken into accounts, which is usually incapable of grasping the correct strengthening and toughening mechanisms. To solve this long-existed problem, an integrated system with the microstructural perception by deep learning (DL) and prediction of mechanical properties by machine learning (ML) was developed, which can quickly and precisely recognize typical ferrite-pearlite microstructures in the most used hot rolled plain carbon steels and make the predictions of their mechanical properties. In the microstructural perception, a U-shaped residual network was proposed to implement deep learning of metallographic images to obtain digital information such as the size and distribution of grains and the lengths of grain and second phase boundaries. As compared to the conventional deep learning algorithm, the pixel accuracy (PA) and frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU) of predictions were improved by 2.84% and 5.27%, respectively. On this basis, the relationships between mechanical properties and the detailed microstructural features were established by using the random forest (RF) algorithm. Compared with the predictions by rough features of average grain size and phase fractions, the root mean square errors (RMSE) of the yield strength (YS), tensile strength (TS), and elongation (EL) based on the test data were reduced by 71.53%, 67.51% and 53.4%, respectively. By using the accurate perceptron for microstructure and properties, changes of strengths and elongations with processing parameters and chemical compositions were analyzed in good agreement with physical laws. Also, this perceptron can be extended to high strength steels with microstructures comprised of ferrite and bainite or complex phases if the data of metallographic images and properties are available.

AB Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is a known risk factor for numerous adverse health outcomes, with varying estimates of component-specific effects. Populations with compromised health conditions such as diabetes can be more sensitive to the health impacts of air pollution exposure. Recent trends in PM2.5 in primarily American Indian-(AI-) populated areas examined in previous work declined more gradually compared to the declines observed in the rest of the US. To further investigate components contributing to these findings, we compared trends in concentrations of six PM2.5 components in AI-vs. non-AI-populated counties over time (2000-2017) in the contiguous US.Methods: We implemented component-specific linear mixed models to estimate differences in annual county-level concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic matter, black carbon, and mineral dust from well -validated surface PM2.5 models in AI-vs. non-AI-populated counties, using a multi-criteria approach to classify counties as AI-or non-AI-populated. Models adjusted for population density and median household income. We included interaction terms with calendar year to estimate whether concentration differences in AI-vs. non -AI-populated counties varied over time. Results: Our final analysis included 3108 counties, with 199 (6.4%) classified as AI-populated. On average across the study period, adjusted concentrations of all six PM2.5 components in AI-populated counties were significantly lower than in non-AI-populated counties. However, component-specific levels in AI-vs. non-AI-populated counties varied over time: sulfate and ammonium levels were significantly lower in AI-vs. non-AI-populated counties before 2011 but higher after 2011 and nitrate levels were consistently lower in AI-populated counties.Conclusions: This study indicates time trend differences of specific components by AI-populated county type. Notably, decreases in sulfate and ammonium may contribute to steeper declines in total PM2.5 in non-AI vs. AI -populated counties. These findings provide potential directives for additional monitoring and regulations of key emissions sources impacting tribal lands.

AB In this research, a single-component multi-colorimetric sensor array was developed to simultaneously detect homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) tumor markers based on their oxidation ability in exposure to silver ions. To this aim, gold nanorods (AuNRs) were used as optical signal transducers. The aspect ratio alterations of AuNRs in response to the concentration of the analytes were achieved by silver shell metallization on the surface of AuNRs. Under optimal conditions, absorbance spectra of the probe and associated vivid color variations were recorded, followed by analysis using a hybrid machine learning classification algorithm to discriminate between HVA, VMA, HVA: VMA along with presumptive interfering compounds (INF). Data was prepared for classification using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), by creating a new space through principal component analysis (PCA). The ideal number of PCs was determined via Leave-Many-Out cross-validation to maximize the classification performance of the model. Besides, partial least squares regression (PLSR), which maximizes covariance between different concentrations of biomarkers, was utilized for quantification. Results indicated that the proposed ML-based sensor array has the potential to diagnose childhood metabolic errors. This is supported by its capability of detecting HVA, VMA, and HVA:VMA concurrently with 100% sensitivity and specificity in human urine samples. Also, a high correlation between predicted and measured values verified the model's exceptional prediction performance with low detection limits of 0.22 mu M and 0.29 mu M for HVA and VMA, respectively.

ID RESPONSES
AB The ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation test is the gold standard for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI), performed with ACTH high dose (HDT) or low dose (LDT). As salivary cortisol has been proposed as an alternative to serum cortisol, our aim was to evaluate the reliability of salivary cortisol compared to serum cortisol for diagnosing AI in children. Data were collected retrospectively. Salivary and serum cortisol values derived by 80 ACTH stimulation tests were obtained (39 F, 36 M; median age 11.5 years, IQR 6.9). Sampling was performed at baseline and after 30 and 60 min from ACTH administration during the HDT, and at baseline and 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 min after the stimulation for the LDT. A serum cortisol level > 420 nmol/L ruled out AI. The correlation coefficients between serum and salivary cortisol for the HDT (n = 24) were 0.80 at t0, 0.48 at t30 and 0.75 at t60. All patients were adrenal sufficient. In 41% of the LDT, peak serum cortisol indicated insufficient adrenal function. The correlation coefficients between serum and salivary cortisol were 0.59 at t0 and 0.33 at the peak. For a cut-off of salivary cortisol < 15 nmol/L, sensitivity was 73.9% and specificity 69.6%. Our data do not support salivary cortisol as a valid alternative to serum cortisol during LDT. Regarding the HDT, results are more encouraging, however, further studies are needed.

AB Objective. The auscultatory technique is still considered the most accurate method for non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement, although its reliability depends on operator's skills. Various methods for automated Korotkoff sounds analysis have been proposed for reliable estimation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures. To this aim, very complex methodologies have been presented, including some based on artificial intelligence (AI). This study proposes a relatively simple methodology, named (BX)-X-3, to estimate SBP and DBP by processing Korotkoff sounds recordings acquired during an auscultatory NIBP measurement. Approach. The beat-by-beat change in morphology of adjacent Korotkoff sounds is evaluated via their cross-correlation. The time series of the beat-by-beat cross-correlation and its first derivative are analyzed to locate the timings of SBP and DBP values. Extensive tests were performed on a public database of 350 annotated measurements, and the performance was evaluated according to the BHS, AAMI/ANSI, and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) quality standards. Main results. The proposed approach achieved 'A' scores for SBP and DBP in the BHS grading system, and passed the quality tests of AAMI/ANSI and ISO standards. The (BX)-X-3 algorithm outperformed two well-established algorithms for oscillometric NIBP measurement in both SBP and DBP estimation. It also outperformed four AI-based algorithms in DBP estimation, while providing comparable performance for SBP, at the cost of a much lower computational burden. The full code of the (BX)-X-3 algorithm is provided in a public repository. Significance. The very good performances ensured by the proposed (BX)-X-3 algorithm, at a low computational cost and without the need for parameter training, support its direct implementation into clinical blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices. The results of this study pave the way for solving/overcoming the trade-off between the accuracy of the auscultatory technique and the objectivity of oscillatory measurements, by bringing an automated auscultatory BP measurement method in clinical practice.

AB Despite significant improvement in prognosis, myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the globe. MI is a life-threatening cardiovascular condition that requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The primary objective of this research is to identify instances of anterior and inferior myocardial infarction by utilizing data obtained from Ultra-wideband radar technology in a hospital for patients of anterior and inferior MI. The collected data is preprocessed to extract spectral features. A novel feature engineering approach is designed to fuse temporal features and class prediction probability features derived from the spectral feature dataset. Several well-known machine learning models are implemented and fine-tuned to obtain optimal performance in the detection of anterior and inferior MI. The results demonstrate that integration of the fused feature set with machine learning models results in a notable improvement in both the accuracy and precision of MI detection. Notably, random forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbor showed superb performance with an accuracy of 98.8%. For demonstrating the capacity of models to generalize, K-fold cross-validation is carried out, wherein RF exhibits a mean accuracy of 99.1%. Furthermore, the examination of computational complexity indicates a low computational complexity, thereby indicating computational efficiency.

AB Given the prevalence of the digital world, artificial intelligence (AI) stands out as one of the most prominent technologies for demand prediction. Although numerous studies have explored energy demand forecasting using machine learning models, previous research has been limited to incorporating either a country's macroeconomic characteristics or exogenous elements as input variables. The simultaneous consideration of both endogenous and exogenous economic elements in demand forecasting has been disregarded. Furthermore, the stability of machine learning models for energy exporters and importers facing varying uncertainties has not been adequately examined. Therefore, this study aims to address these gaps by investigating these issues comprehensively. To accomplish this objective, data from 30 countries spanning the period from 2000 to 2020 was selected. In predicting oil demand, endogenous economic variables, such as carbon emissions, income level, energy price, gross domestic product (GDP), population growth, urbanization, trade liberalization, inflation, foreign direct investment (FDI), and financial development, were considered alongside exogenous factors, including energy sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings indicate that among the input variables examined in demand forecasting, oil sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic have had the most significant impact on reducing oil demand, while trade liberalization has proven to be the most influential factor in increasing oil demand. Furthermore, the support vector regression (SVR) model outperforms other models in terms of lower prediction error, as revealed by the error assessment of statistical models and AI in forecasting oil demand. Additionally, when comparing the stability of models in oil exporting and importing countries facing different levels of demand uncertainty, the SVR model demonstrates higher stability compared to other models.

AB The emergence of artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered information technology, such as deep learning and natural language processing, enables human to shift their behaving or working diagram from human-only to human-AI synergy, especially in the decision-making process. Since AI is multidisciplinary by nature and our understanding of human-AI synergy in decision-making is fragmented, we conducted a literature review to systematically characterize the phenomenon. Adopting the affordance actualization theory, we developed a framework to organize and understand the relationship between AI affordances, the human-AI synergy process, and the outcomes of human-AI synergy. Three themes emerged from the review: the identification of AI affordances in decision-making, human-AI synergy patterns regarding different decision tasks, and outcomes of human-AI synergy in decision-making. For each theme, we provided evidence on the existing research gaps and proposed future research directions. Our findings provide a holistic framework for understanding human-AI synergy phenomenon in decision-making. This work also offers theoretical contributions and research directions for researchers studying human-AI synergy in decision-making.

AB The systematic literature review (SLR) is the gold standard in providing research a firm evidence foundation to support decision-making. Researchers seeking to increase the rigour, transparency, and replicability of their SLRs are provided a range of guidelines towards these ends. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning Techniques (MLTs) developed with computer programming languages can provide methods to increase the speed, rigour, transparency, and repeatability of SLRs. Aimed towards researchers with coding experience, and who want to utilise AI and MLTs to synthesise and abstract data obtained through a SLR, this article sets out how computer languages can be used to facilitate unsupervised machine learning for synthesising and abstracting data sets extracted during a SLR. Utilising an already known qualitative method, Deductive Qualitative Analysis, this article illustrates the supportive role that AI and MLTs can play in the coding and categorisation of extracted SLR data, and in synthesising SLR data. Using a data set extracted during a SLR as a proof of concept, this article will include the coding used to create a well-established MLT, Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet allocation. This technique provides a working example of how researchers can use AI and MLTs to automate the data synthesis and abstraction stage of their SLR, and aide in increasing the speed, frugality, and rigour of research projects.

TI Making green growth a reality: Reconciling sobriety with stakeholders'
   satisfaction
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ENERGY
AB The notion of sobriety is considered a key variable in various energy transition scenarios. Often associated with a form of punitive ecology, it is, nevertheless, possible to make it a component that supports green growth, by linking it to the concept of "satisfaction". In this work, we have invented a way to achieve both "digital", "economic", and "ecological" sobriety, while ensuring the satisfaction of the end user. Directly correlated to the production of goods or services, the satisfaction function is built on the well-documented marginal utility function, which measures the need (or not) to consume further resources to satisfy the economic agents. Hence, it is justified and exists because it stands for the expectations of end users and makes sure the latter is met. This product itself is a function of the allocation of a set of resources, mapped using activity-based costing tools (ABC method). In this work, we focus on an AI proof-of-concept and demonstrate that it is possible to reach numerical sobriety by controlling the size of the training dataset while ensuring roughly the same model performance. In general, we show that it is possible to preserve the efficiency of AI processes while significantly minimizing the need for resources. In this sense, after establishing an analytical model, we suggest reducing the amount of data required to train the machine learning (ML) models, while guaranteeing zero change in terms of performance (say their accuracy). We show that it affects the energy consumed, and, thereby, the associated cost (i.e., economic and ecological) and the associated CO2eq emission. We thus confirm the existence of a "triangle of sobriety". It is defined as a virtual circle governed by a digital -economic-ecological sovereignty. We also propose that if AI production processes have a potential for sobriety, all identical activities have the same characteristics, thus opening the path to green growth.

AB The vaginal microbiota has been shown to be important in local immune regulation and may play a role in reproduction and fertility. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been used to characterize the bovine vaginal microbiota, mainly using short-read sequencing (Illumina). However, the main limitation of this technique is its inability to classify bacteria at the species level. The objective of this study was to characterize the bovine vaginal microbiota at the species level using long-read sequencing (PacBio) and to compare it with the results of short-read sequencing. In addition, the vaginal microbiota of cows that became pregnant after artificial insemination (AI) was compared with that of infertile animals. Thirteen Holstein cows had vaginal swabs collected prior to AI. DNA was extracted and subjected to Illumina and PacBio sequencing to characterize the V4 region and the entire 16S rRNA gene, respectively. PacBio sequencing yielded 366,509 reads that were assigned to 476 species from 27 phyla. However, none of the most abundant reads (>1%) could be classified at the species level. Illumina sequencing yielded more reads and consequently was able to detect a more observed species, but PacBio sequencing was able to detect more unique and rare species. The composition of the vaginal microbiota varies according to the sequencing method used, which might complicate the interpretation of results obtained in the majority of the current studies. The present study expands on the current knowledge of bovine microbiota, highlighting the need for further efforts to improve the current databanks.

AB AI super-resolution, combining deep learning and N-body simulations, has been shown to successfully reproduce the large-scale structure and halo abundances in the Lambda cold dark matter cosmological model. Here, we extend its use to models with a different dark matter content, in this case fuzzy dark matter (FDM), in the approximation that the difference is encoded in the initial power spectrum. We focus on redshift z = 2, with simulations that model smaller scales and lower masses, the latter by two orders of magnitude, than has been done in previous AI super-resolution work. We find that the super-resolution technique can reproduce the power spectrum and halo mass function to within a few per cent of full high-resolution calculations. We also find that halo artefacts, caused by spurious numerical fragmentation of filaments, are equally present in the super-resolution outputs. Although we have not trained the super-resolution algorithm using full quantum pressure FDM simulations, the fact that it performs well at the relevant length and mass scales means that it has promise as a technique that could avoid the very high computational cost of the latter, in some contexts. We conclude that AI super-resolution can become a useful tool to extend the range of dark matter models covered in mock catalogues.

AB As one of the most prominent parts of the Internet, World Wide Web (WWW) has achieved great success and penetrated every area of our lives. However, the cu rrent WWW still suffers from inefficiency, growing concerns about user privacy and data ownership, and poor Quality of Experience. Therefore, we propose a promising architecture for the next-generation WWW, Web 3.0, which is underpinned by Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Blockchain-empowered Metaverse (AlB-Metaverse). Fueled by native Al, Web 3.0 based on AlB-Metaverse can provide users with a personalized experience and enable smart decision-making with high efficiency. Backed by Blockchain, the AIB-Metaverse-based Web 3.0 is decentralized, which can help users regain full control of data and protect the ownership of generated data while preserving privacy. Furthermore, this new architecture can provide a ubiquitous immersive experience to users during real-time interaction with digital avatars in the Metaverse. To verify the effectiveness of Al in Web 3.0, we propose an Al-based approach for Metaverse video delivery, which can significantly enhance the quality of immersive experience perceived by users in Web 3.0. In addition, we pinpoint the challenges faced by the proposed AlB-Metaverse-based Web 3.0 and highlight pertinent research directions in the future.

AB Significance: Diabetes is a prevalent disease worldwide that can cause severe health problems. Accurate blood glucose detection is crucial for diabetes management, and noninvasive methods can be more convenient and less painful than traditional finger-prick methods. Aim: We aim to report a noncontact speckle-based blood glucose measurement system that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) data processing to improve glucose detection accuracy. The study also explores the influence of an alternating current (AC) induced magnetic field on the sensitivity and selectivity of blood glucose detection.
   Approach: The proposed blood glucose sensor consists of a digital camera, an AC-generated magnetic field source, a laser illuminating the subject's finger, and a computer. A magnetic field is applied to the finger, and a camera records the speckle patterns generated by the laser light reflected from the finger. The acquired video data are preprocessed for machine learning (ML) and deep neural networks (DNNs) to classify blood plasma glucose levels. The standard finger-prick method is used as a reference for blood glucose level classification.
   Results: The study found that the noncontact speckle-based blood glucose measurement system with AI data processing allows for the detection of blood plasma glucose levels with high accuracy. The ML approach gives better results than the tested DNNs as the proposed data preprocessing is highly selective and efficient.
   Conclusions: The proposed noncontact blood glucose sensing mechanism utilizing AI data processing and a magnetic field can potentially improve glucose detection accuracy, making it more convenient and less painful for patients. The system also allows for inexpensive blood glucose sensing mechanisms and fast blood glucose screening. The results suggest that noninvasive methods can improve blood glucose detection accuracy, which can have significant implications for diabetes management. Investigations involving representative sampling data, including subjects of different ages, gender, race, and health status, could allow for further improvement.

In a preregistered online experiment, we assigned occupation-specific, incentivized writing tasks to 453 college-educated professionals and randomly exposed half of them to ChatGPT. Our results show that ChatGPT substantially raised productivity: The average time taken decreased by 40% and output quality rose by 18%. Inequality between workers decreased, and concern and excitement about AI temporarily rose. Workers exposed to ChatGPT during the experiment were 2 times as likely to report using it in their real job 2 weeks after the experiment and 1.6 times as likely 2 months after the experiment.

AB The aim of this paper is to report the partial results of an exploratory investigation into how twelve psychoanalysts of different theoretical-clinical orientations perceive and use hypotheses about the phenomena of change in connection with selected material from a psychoanalytic treatment. The Three-Level Model (3-LM) was used for the observation of patient transformations and for the collection of data. This was followed by the statistical analysis of the behaviour and relationship of a set of variables relating to the type and degree of change perceived in the patient's mental functioning during the course of her treatment. The results reported here show that there was significant agreement among the participants, irrespective of their theoretical-clinical orientation, as regards the following: 1) the positive impact of the application of psychoanalytic treatment in diverse areas of the patient's mental functioning; 2) the explanatory hypotheses of the changes observed in the patient under consideration; 3) the usefulness of the experience of group exchange using the 3-LM in observing and understanding the changes in the patient.
   L'objectif de cet article est de rendre compte des resultats partiels d'une recherche exploratoire sur la facon dont douze psychanalystes aux orientations theorico-cliniques differentes percoivent et utilisent les hypotheses relatives aux phenomenes de changement, qui seront reliees a un materiel extrait d'un traitement analytique. Le Modele a trois niveaux (3-LM) a ete utilise pour observer les transformations chez une patiente, ainsi que pour collecter des donnees, et a ete suivi d'une analyse statistique du comportement et de la relation d'une serie de variables en lien avec le type et le degre de changement percu au niveau du fonctionnement mental de la patiente dans le cours de l'analyse. Les resultats rapportes ici montrent qu'il y avait un accord significatif parmi les participants, independamment de leur orientation theorico-clinique, par rapport a : 1) l'impact positif de l'application du traitement psychanalytique a differentes parties du fonctionnement mental ; 2) les hypotheses explicatives des changements observes chez la patiente en question ; 3) l'utilite de l'experience des echanges dans le groupe relatifs au 3-LM pour observer et comprendre les changements chez la patiente.
   Ziel dieses Beitrags ist es, die Teilergebnisse einer explorativen Studie darzustellen, in der untersucht wurde, wie zwolf Psychoanalytiker unterschiedlicher theoretisch-klinischer Ausrichtung Hypothesen uber Veranderungsphanomene im Zusammenhang mit ausgewahltem Material aus einer psychoanalytischen Behandlung wahrnehmen und verwenden. Das Drei-Ebenen-Modell (3-LM) wurde fur die Beobachtung von Patientenveranderungen und fur die Datenerhebung verwendet. Darauf folgte die statistische Analyse des Verhaltens und der Beziehung einer Reihe von Variablen, die sich auf die Art und den Grad der wahrgenommenen Veranderung der psychischen Funktionsfahigkeit der Patienten im Laufe ihrer Behandlung beziehen. Die hier berichteten Ergebnisse zeigen, dass unter den Teilnehmern, unabhangig von ihrer theoretisch-klinischen Ausrichtung, eine signifikante ubereinstimmung in Bezug auf Folgendes bestand: 1) die positiven Auswirkungen der Anwendung der psychoanalytischen Behandlung auf verschiedene Bereiche der psychischen Funktionsfahigkeit der Patientin; 2) die Erklarungshypothesen fur die bei den Patienten beobachteten Veranderungen; 3) die Nutzlichkeit der Erfahrung des Gruppenaustauschs unter Anwendung der 3-LM bei der Beobachtung und dem Verstandnis der Veranderungen beim Patienten.
   Il presente articolo si propone di riferire i risultati, ancora parziali, di un'indagine esplorativa circa il modo in cui dodici psicoanalisti di diverso orientamento teorico-clinico sentono e utilizzano ipotesi relative ai fenomeni di cambiamento presenti nel materiale clinico di un trattamento psicoanalitico. Il Modello a Tre Livelli (3-LM) e stato usato per l'osservazione delle trasformazioni dei pazienti e per la raccolta dei dati. A queste fasi ha fatto seguito l'analisi statistica del comportamento e delle relazioni di un insieme di variabili concernenti il tipo e il grado di cambiamento percepito nel funzionamento mentale del paziente durante il trattamento.I risultati qui riportati mostrano una notevole convergenza di opinione tra i partecipanti, a prescindere dai rispettivi orientamenti teorico-clinici, relativamente ai seguenti aspetti: 1) l'impatto positivo dell'applicazione del trattamento psicoanalitico in diverse aree del funzionamento mentale del paziente; 2) le ipotesi esplicative rispetto ai cambiamenti osservati nei vari pazienti in esame; 3) l'utilita dell'esperienza dello scambio di gruppo quando si utilizza il 3-LM per osservare e comprendere i cambiamenti nel paziente.

TI Efficacy of segmented axial length and artificial intelligence
   approaches to intraocular lens power calculation in short eyes
SO JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
ID CATARACT-SURGERY; OUTCOMES
AB Purpose: In short eyes, to compare the predictive accuracy of newer intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas using traditional and segmented axial length (AL) measurements.
   Setting: Cullen Eye Institute, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas and East Valley Ophthalmology, Mesa, Arizona.
   Design: Multi-center retrospective case series.
   Methods: Measurements from an optical biometer were collected in eyes with AL <22 mm. IOL power calculations were performed with 15 formulas using 2 AL values: (1) machinereported traditional AL (Td-AL) and (2) segmented AL calculated with the Cooke- modified AL nomogram (CMAL). 1 AL method and 7 formulas were selected for pairwise analysis of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square absolute error (RMSAE).
   Results: The study comprised 278 eyes. Compared with the Td-AL, the CMAL produced hyperopic shifts without differences in RMSAE. The ZEISS AI IOL Calculator (ZEISS AI), K6, Kane, Hill-RBF, Pearl-DGS, EVO, and Barrett Universal II (Barrett) formulas with Td-AL were compared pairwise. The ZEISS AI demonstrated smaller MAE and RMSAE than the Barrett, Pearl-DGS, and Kane. K6 had a smaller RMSAE than the Barrett formula. In 73 eyes with shallow anterior chamber depth, the ZEISS AI and Kane had a smaller RMSAE than the Barrett.
   Conclusions: ZEISS AI outperformed Barrett, Pearl-DGS, and Kane. The K6 formula outperformed some formulas in selected parameters. Across all formulas, use of a segmented AL did not improve refractive predictions.

AB The domestic buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), also known as water buffalo, comprises two sub-species the River buffalo (B. bubalis ssp. bubalis; 50 chromosomes) and the Swamp buffalo (ssp. carabanensis; 48 chromosomes). Domestic buffaloes are a globally significant livestock species. In South Asia, the River buffalo is a primary source of milk and meat and has a very important role in food security. The River buffalo also supports high-value, differentiated food production in Europe and the Americas. The Swamp buffalo is an important draft animal and a source of food in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The growing importance of buffaloes requires that they undergo an accelerated rate of genetic gain for efficiency of production, product quality, and sustainability. This will involve the increased use of assisted reproduction. The initial application of reproductive technology in buffaloes had variable success as it relied on the adoption of procedures developed for cattle. This included artificial insemination (AI), sperm cryopreservation, and embryo technologies such as cloning and in vitro embryo production (IVEP). Reproductive technology has been progressively refined in buffaloes, and today, the success of AI and IVEP is comparable to cattle. Ovarian follicular superstimulation (superovulation) combined with in vivo embryo production results in low embryo recovery in buffaloes and has limited practical application. The contribution of elite female buffaloes to future genetic improvement will therefore rely mainly on oocyte pickup and IVEP. This will include IVEP from females before puberty to reduce generation intervals. This review provides for the first time a clear chronology on the development, adoption, and impact, of assisted reproduction in domestic buffaloes. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

It appears that timing of conceptus attachment, defined as an initial daily rise in pregnancy-specific protein B (PSPB) postartificial insemination (AI), is key to the survival of the embryo. PSPB is a protein produced from binucleate cells of the trophectoderm of the conceptus. Once the conceptus has attached to the uterine epithelial cells, this large protein is detectable in maternal circulation. Daily sampling of serum allows for detection of the initial increase of PSPB. A percent increase threshold for PSPB was determined from results from each study using a conservative three-day minimum increase. Thus far, a 10 or 12.5% daily increase for three consecutive days had the greatest sensitivities and specificities for studies reported in this review. Nulliparous heifers receiving AI following estrus appear to have a reduced time to conceptus attachment compared to lactating cows that received either Ovsynch or AI following estrus. Increasing progesterone post-AI did not reduce time to conceptus attachment in lactating cows. Multiparous cows treated post-AI with human chorionic gonadotropin had a reduced percent with conceptus attachment in addition to greater time to conceptus attachment. Increased time to conceptus attachment increased the chances of multiparous cows having embryonic death before 35 d post-AI. Concentrations of PSPB are consistently reduced from conceptus attachment until d 28 post-AI in cows with pregnancy loss compared to cows that maintain pregnancy on d 34 post-AI. This novel model to determine timing of conceptus attachment provides a new perspective on percent of cows pregnant around d 20-23 post-AI and the potential for a greater understanding of subsequent pregnancy loss.

AB Artificial insemination (AI) and in vivo embryo production (or multiple ovulation and embryo transfer, MOET) programs are both instrumental in accelerating the propagation of genetically and economically superior goats and sheep. The aim of this review was to present the current gestalt of non-surgical AI and embryo recovery (NSER) procedures in small ruminants. Small body size, precluding rectal palpation, and highly limited penetrability of the uterine cervix in ewes are the major reasons for the scarce use of non-surgical assisted reproduction techniques in this species. As a result, AI and embryo recovery techniques in sheep mainly involve laparoscopy or laparotomy (LAP). In does, however, the Embrapa method of AI allows for successful intrauterine deposition of semen, resulting in pregnancy rates from 50 to 80% under field conditions (>3 000 goats inseminated) when frozen-thawed semen is used. After the administration of prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)), non-surgical (transcervical) embryo recovery is also feasible in goats, with the cervical penetration rate approaching 100%. There is a paucity of information on the efficacy of non-surgical AI using frozen semen in sheep, but the results are satisfactory with fresh, cooled, or chilled ram semen. An application of the NSER technique in ewes has greatly improved over the last decade, and cervical penetration rates of similar to 90% can be achieved when a hormonal cervical dilation protocol using PGF(2 alpha), oxytocin, and/or estradiol ester (e.g., estradiol benzoate) is applied. In some genotypes of sheep, sufficient cervical dilation can be induced without estradiol ester included in the protocol. Several studies indicated that recovery of transferable quality ovine embryos using NSER is comparable to that employing a ventral midline laparotomy, and NSER is evidently a method of choice when animal welfare is concerned. Considering both the number of retrievable embryos and animal well-being, the NSER is a viable alternative for surgical procedures. With further developments, it has the makings of a primary, if not exclusive, embryo recovery technique in small ruminants worldwide. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB The three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of pulmonary nodules using medical images has introduced new technical approaches for diagnosing and treating pulmonary nodules, and these approaches are progressively being acknowledged and adopted by physicians and patients. Nonetheless, constructing a relatively universal 3D digital model of pulmonary nodules for diagnosis and treatment is challenging due to device differences, shooting times, and nodule types. The objective of this study is to propose a new 3D digital model of pulmonary nodules that serves as a bridge between physicians and patients and is also a cutting-edge tool for pre-diagnosis and prognostic evaluation. Many AI-driven pulmonary nodule detection and recognition methods employ deep learning techniques to capture the radiological features of pulmonary nodules, and these methods can achieve a good area under-the-curve (AUC) performance. However, false positives and false negatives remain a challenge for radiologists and clinicians. The interpretation and expression of features from the perspective of pulmonary nodule classification and examination are still unsatisfactory. In this study, a method of continuous 3D reconstruction of the whole lung in horizontal and coronal positions is proposed by combining existing medical image processing technologies. Compared with other applicable methods, this method allows users to rapidly locate pulmonary nodules and identify their fundamental properties while also observing pulmonary nodules from multiple perspectives, thereby providing a more effective clinical tool for diagnosing and treating pulmonary nodules.

ID CLASSIFICATION; INTERVENTION; QUALITY; CARE
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of theories and techniques in which machines are used to simulate human intelligence with complex computer programs. The various machine learning (ML) methods are a subtype of AI. They originate from computer science and use algorithms established from analyzing a database to accomplish certain tasks. Among these methods are decision trees or random forests, support vector machines along with artificial neural networks. Convolutive neural networks were inspired from the visual cortex; they process combinations of information used in image or voice recognition. Deep learning (DL) groups together a set of ML methods and is useful for modeling complex relationships with a high degree of abstraction by using multiple layers of artificial neurons. ML techniques have a growing role in spine surgery. The main applications are the segmentation of intraoperative images for surgical navigation or robotics used for pedicle screw placement, the interpretation of images of intervertebral discs or full spine radiographs, which can be automated using ML algorithms. ML techniques can also be used as aids for surgical decision-making in complex fields, such as preoperative evaluation of adult spinal deformity. ML algorithms "learn" from large clinical databases. They make it possible to establish the intraoperative risk level and make a prognosis on how the postoperative functional scores will change over time as a function of the patient profile. These applications open a new path relative to standard statistical analyses. They make it possible to explore more complex relationships with multiple indirect interactions. In the future, AI algorithms could have a greater role in clinical research, evaluating clinical and surgical practices, and conducting health economics analyses. (C) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB The subject of autonomy within unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has proven to be a remarkable research field - mostly due to the development of AI techniques within embedded advanced bespoke microcontrollers - during the last several decades. For drones, as safety-critical systems, there is an increasing need for onboard detect & avoid (DAA) technology i) to see, sense or detect conflicting traffic or imminent non-cooperative threats due to their high mobility with multiple degrees of freedom and the complexity of deployed unstructured environments, and subsequently ii) to take the appropriate actions to avoid collisions depending upon the level of autonomy. The safe and efficient integration of UAV traffic management (UTM) systems with air traffic management (ATM) systems, using intelligent autonomous approaches, is an emerging requirement where the number of diverse UAV applications is increasing on a large scale in dense air traffic environments for completing swarms of multiple complex missions flexibly and simultaneously. Significant progress over the past few years has been made in detecting UAVs present in aerospace, identifying them, and determining their existing flight path. This study makes greater use of electronic conspicuity (EC) information made available by PilotAware Ltd (https://www.pilotaware.com) in developing an advanced collision management methodology - Drone Aware Collision Management (DACM) - capable of determining and executing a variety of time-optimal evasive collision avoidance (CA) manoeuvres using a reactive geometric conflict detection and resolution (CDR) technique. The merits of the DACM methodology have been demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world field tests in avoiding mid-air collisions (MAC) between UAVs and manned aeroplanes. The results show that the proposed methodology can be employed successfully in avoiding collisions while limiting the deviation from the original trajectory in highly dynamic aerospace without requiring sophisticated sensors and prior training. With the proposed technological improvement equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, MAC risks which cannot be avoided with the current off-the-shelf sensor technologies, in particular, between flights with very high velocities, can be definitely prevented with the accurate measurements and state and situation awareness (SSA) that uses a global coverage strategy with real-time low latency EC data feeds acquired from all aircraft. The MAC standards, dictated by the aviation authorities, can be mandated for UAVs considering the reliable decision-making abilities of DACM - without creating new collision risks during evasive manoeuvres, which can expedite the safe and efficient integration of UAVs into ATM systems.

AB Proliferation of data sources associated to Internet of Things (IoT) deployment as well as those bound to Open Data Portals (e.g. European Data Portal, Municipalities Open Data Portals, etc.) and Social Media platforms is creating an abundance of information that is called to bring benefits for both the private and public sectors, through the development of added-value services, increasing administrations' transparency and availability or fostering efficiency of public services. However, pieces of information without a context are significantly less valuable. Raw data lacks semantics and it is highly heterogeneous from one data-source to another. This poses a challenge to make it useful. To turn all this data into valuable information it is necessary to enable its combination so that meaningful context can be created. Moreover, it is fundamental to define the mechanisms enabling the adoption and orchestration of advanced (typically AI-enabled) data processing techniques to be applied over the harmonized datasets and data-streams. This paper presents the Data Enrichment Toolchain (DET) that provides the necessary harmonization and enrichment to datasets and data-streams coming from heterogeneous sources. The value of the enriched data lies on the one hand in the transfer of the data into a semantically grounded knowledge graph and, on the other hand, in the creation of new data through linking, aggregating and reasoning on the data. In both cases, the benefit of employing linked-data modelling and semantics comes from the extension of the metadata that is associated to every piece of information. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation of the DET implementation that we have carried out is also presented in the paper.

AB The fire safety management policy is the premise for city managers to master the urban fire safety situation and solve the urban fire safety problems. An excellent fire safety management policy can obtain the basic data of fire safety, analyze the existing problems and potential safety hazards, and provide targeted measures for urban fire safety management. At present, the traditional fire safety management policy has exposed many shortcomings, such as the lack of technical support for firefighting means, inaccurate fire data analysis, etc., which ultimately led to low fire extinguishing efficiency and wasted some human and material resources. In the context of smart cities, big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) have gradually integrated into various fields of urban development. This paper studied the fire safety management policies of smart cities based on BD analysis method. First, it summarized the relationship among BD, AI and smart cities, then analyzed the limitations of traditional urban fire safety management models, and finally proposed new fire safety management methods based on BD, AI and sustainable development. This article analyzed the urban fire protection situation from January to June 2022 in Nanchang, and verified the effectiveness of the method proposed in this article. Research has shown that the new fire safety management policy has reduced the number of fires, improved fire extinguishing efficiency by 9.07%, reduced property damage and casualties, and has a high recognition of the method. This also provides a reference for the next step of BD's application in smart cities.

AB We present an approach for automated fact-checking, given a trusted knowledge base and a natural language text. The FACE (FAct Checker with Explanations) system is capable of extracting the knowledge behind the sentences, and decide what is entailed in the trusted sources and what is in conflict with them, providing also explanations and counter speeches in English. The system also specifies the provenance of each of its argument, thus it can be traced back to the source of the information.
   Description logic representation of the input is obtained using the FRED machine reader, which is further improved by detecting and handling translation patterns. The obtained ontology is aligned to the knowledge base using the WordNet database in a custom algorithm, then entailment and conflict detection is performed with the Hermit reasoner, through which we obtain the explanations and counter speeches which are verbalized to Attempto Controlled English.
   The fact checker is demonstrated on Covid-19 related sentences, however it is domain independent, and can be used with other knowledge bases as well.

AB Machine Learning systems based on deep neural networks are powerful tools but their wide adoption has shown that both the designers and the users of DNN models must fight the barriers of understanding and controlling what has been learnt from data. To make such systems explainable and interpretable, model-specific post-hoc methods have been developed in the literature. This paper presents a family of such methods, Class Activation Mapping, used to explain the image classification process in Convolutional Neural Networks, and achieves a thorough evaluation of these methods. The analysis is done both a qualitative point of view, through the visualization of the activation heatmap of the image, and from a quantitative point of view, through several metrics that try to objectively quantify the relevant parts of an image which contributed to the classification. Several datasets are used to evaluate the discussed methods and a comparison between the obtained results is presented.

AB Energy management in smart homes is one of the most critical problems for the Quality of Life (QoL) and preserving energy resources. One of the relevant issues in this subject is environmental contamination, which threatens the world's future. Green computing-enabled Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can provide impactful solutions to this topic. This research proposes using one of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to comprehend how it is feasible to perform the cloud/fog/edge-enabled prediction of the building's energy. Four parameters of power electricity, power heating, power cooling, and total power in an office/home in cold-climate cities are considered as our features in the study. Based on the collected data, we evaluate the LSTM approach for forecasting parameters for the next year to predict energy consumption and online monitoring of the model's performance under various conditions. Towards implementing the AI predictive algorithm, several existing tools are studied. The results have been generated through simulations, and we find them promising for future applications.

AB All-inorganic perovskite (CsPbX3) nanocrystals (NCs) have recently been widely investigated as versatile solution-processable light-emitting materials. Due to its wide-bandgap nature, the all-inorganic perovskite NC Light-Emitting Diode (LED) is limited to the visible region (400-700 nm). A particularly difficult challenge lies in the practical application of perovskite NCs in the infrared-spectrum region. In this work, a 980 nm NIR all-inorganic perovskite NC LED is demonstrated, which is based on an efficient energy transfer from wide-bandgap materials (CsPbCl3 NCs) to ytterbium ions (Yb3+) as an NIR emitter doped in perovskite NCs. The optimized CsPbCl3 NC with 15 mol%Yb3+ doping concentration has the strongest 980 nm photoluminescence (PL) peak, with a PL quantum yield of 63%. An inverted perovskite NC LED is fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/poly-TPD/CsPbCl3: 15 mol%Yb3+ NCs/TPBi/LiF/AI. The LED has an External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) of 0.2%, a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 47 nm, and a maximum luminescence of 182 cd/m(2). The introduction of Yb3+ doping in perovskite NCs makes it possible to expand its working wavelength to near-infrared band for next-generation light sources and shows potential applications for optoelectronic integration.

AB As one of the most complex parts in manufacturing systems, scheduling plays an important role in the efficient allocation of resources to meet individual customization requirements. However, due to the uncertain disruptions (e.g., task arrival time, service breakdown duration) of manufacturing processes, how to respond to various dynamics in manufacturing to keep the scheduling process moving forward smoothly and efficiently is becoming a major challenge in dynamic manufacturing scheduling. To solve such a problem, a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to (1) accurately construct dynamic scheduling models that can represent both personalized customer needs and uncertain provider capabilities and (2) efficiently obtain a qualified schedule within a limited time. From these two perspectives, this article systemically makes a state-of-the-art literature survey on the application of these artificial intelligence techniques in dynamic manufacturing modeling and scheduling. It first introduces two types of dynamic scheduling problems that consider service- and task-related disruptions in the manufacturing process, respectively, followed by a bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence techniques for dynamic manufacturing scheduling. Next, various kinds of artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers for solving dynamic scheduling problems including both directed heuristics and autonomous learning methods are reviewed, which strive not only to quickly obtain optimized solutions but also to effectively achieve the adaption to dynamics. Finally, this article further elaborates on the future opportunities and challenges of using artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers to solve complex dynamic scheduling problems. In summary, this survey aims to present a thorough and organized overview of artificial-intelligence-enabled dynamic manufacturing scheduling and shed light on some related research directions that are worth studying in the future.

AB Medical Artificial Intelligence (MedAI) harnesses the power of medical research through AI algorithms and vast data to address healthcare challenges. The security, integrity, and credibility of MedAI tools are paramount, because human lives are at stake. Predatory research, in a culture of "publish or perish," is exploiting the "pay for publish" model to infiltrate he research literature repositories. Although, it is challenging to measure the actual predatory research induced data pollution and patient harm, ourwork shows that the breached integrity of MedAI inputs is a serious threat to trust the MedAI output. We review a wide range of research literature discussing the threats of data pollution in the research literature, feasible attacks impacting MedAI solutions, research literature-based tools, and influence on healthcare. Our contribution lies in presenting a comprehensive literature review, addressing the gap of predatory research vulnerabilities affecting MedAI solutions, and helping to develop robust MedAI solutions in the future.

AB This paper presents a sequential model based on Physic Based Models (PBM) and Artificial Intelligence Models (AI) focused on the estimation of the State of Charge (SoC). The PBM can provide interesting information about the internal physical variables of the battery, which relate directly with the momentary SoC of the cell. This way, we can use this information to feed the AI model alongside with application measurements to obtain an accurate SoC estimation. By their nature, PBMs can potentially provide immense numbers of internal variables, some of which are irrelevant and redundant for the AI model. To solve this, a feature selection technique based on the regression score is introduced between both models. Selecting the most relevant variables we can build a model that reduces the computational cost of the model while improving the performance compared to using every feature. With this baseline, a Reduced-Order Model (ROM) with parameters from literature has been implemented in the PBM part and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network on the ML side. With this configuration and the PBM simplification the model needs little laboratory tests and low computational cost to outperform alternative solutions, which has been experimentally validated in different operating conditions of the cell.

AB Now, deep learning technology has gradually matured and successfully applied in various fields, bringing great convenience to human life. However, people neglect the importance of early sample collection and data processing while continuously improving the quality of network models, which often leads to poor application effect of models in practical projects. At present, the Data-centric AI campaign has started in the field of deep learning, with the purpose of letting researchers pay attention to the quality of data. This paper proposes a sample selecting method based on feature density from the motion idea, which can be applied to practical application scenarios where there is a huge deviation in the distribution of train set and test set, the dataset redundancy is too high, and the dataset sampling is guided. This method uses ternary loss function to constrain and aggregate sample feature points, constructs feature density space through feature extractor, traverses feature points to calculate distance between samples, judges special category redundancy and deletes redundant samples, and finally retains samples as highly representative samples to optimize dataset distribution. In the experiment, the self-built dataset IP05 are used in this paper. Sufficient experimental results show that the samples selected by the feature density sample selecting method are indeed more representative.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools are widely employed, but their use for diagnosis and prognosis of neurological disorders is still evolving. Here we analyse a cross-sectional multicentre structural MRI dataset of 696 people with epilepsy and 118 control subjects. We use an innovative machine-learning algorithm, Subtype and Stage Inference, to develop a novel data-driven disease taxonomy, whereby epilepsy subtypes correspond to distinct patterns of spatiotemporal progression of brain atrophy.In a discovery cohort of 814 individuals, we identify two subtypes common to focal and idiopathic generalized epilepsies, characterized by progression of grey matter atrophy driven by the cortex or the basal ganglia. A third subtype, only detected in focal epilepsies, was characterized by hippocampal atrophy. We corroborate external validity via an independent cohort of 254 people and confirm that the basal ganglia subtype is associated with the most severe epilepsy.Our findings suggest fundamental processes underlying the progression of epilepsy-related brain atrophy. We deliver a novel MRI- and AI-guided epilepsy taxonomy, which could be used for individualized prognostics and targeted therapeutics.
   Using artificial intelligence algorithms, Xiao et al. identify distinct subtypes of spatiotemporal progression of brain atrophy in focal and generalised epilepsies, which variably involve cortex, basal ganglia and hippocampus, and which relate to clinical characteristics.

AB Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have ushered in a new era of possibilities across various scientific domains. One area where these advancements hold significant promise is model-informed drug discovery and development (MID3). To foster a wider adoption and acceptance of these advanced algorithms, the Innovation and Quality (IQ) Consortium initiated the AI/ML working group in 2021 with the aim of promoting their acceptance among the broader scientific community as well as by regulatory agencies. By drawing insights from workshops organized by the working group and attended by key stakeholders across the biopharma industry, academia, and regulatory agencies, this white paper provides a perspective from the IQ Consortium. The range of applications covered in this white paper encompass the following thematic topics: (i) AI/ML-enabled Analytics for Pharmacometrics and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) Workflows; (ii) Explainable Artificial Intelligence and its Applications in Disease Progression Modeling; (iii) Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Quantitative Pharmacology Modeling; and (iv) AI/ML Utilization in Drug Discovery. Additionally, the paper offers a set of best practices to ensure an effective and responsible use of AI, including considering the context of use, explainability and generalizability of models, and having human-in-the-loop. We believe that embracing the transformative power of AI in quantitative modeling while adopting a set of good practices can unlock new opportunities for innovation, increase efficiency, and ultimately bring benefits to patients.

TI Sparse Backdoor Attack Against Neural Networks

DE Backdoor attack; AI security; Trustworthy AI
AB Recent studies show that neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, in which compromised networks behave normally for clean inputs but make mistakes when a pre-defined trigger appears. Although prior studies have designed various invisible triggers to avoid causing visual anomalies, they cannot evade some trigger detectors. In this paper, we consider the stealthiness of backdoor attacks from input space and feature representation space. We propose a novel backdoor attack named sparse backdoor attack, and investigate the minimum required trigger to induce the well-trained networks to make incorrect results. A U-net-based generator is employed to create triggers for each clean image. Considering the stealthiness of the trigger, we restrict the elements of the trigger between -1 and 1. In the aspect of the feature representation domain, we adopt an entanglement cost function to minimize the gap between feature representations of benign and malicious inputs. The inseparability of benign and malicious feature representations contributes to the stealthiness of our attack against various model diagnosis-based defences. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method by conducting extensive experiments on multiple datasets and networks.

AB An "ensemble" approach to decision-making involves aggregating the results from different decision makers solving the same problem (i.e., a division of labor without specialization). We draw on the literatures on machine learning-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) as well as on human decision-making to propose conditions under which human-AI ensembles can be useful. We argue that human and AI-based algorithmic decision-making can be usefully ensembled even when neither has a clear advantage over the other in terms of predictive accuracy, and even if neither alone can attain satisfactory accuracy in absolute terms. Many managerial decisions have these attributes, and collaboration between humans and AI is usually ruled out in such contexts because the conditions for specialization are not met. However, we propose that human-AI collaboration through ensembling is still a possibility under the conditions we identify.

ID ATLANTIC FOREST; LANDSCAPE; CHINA
AB Deforestation has led to substantial loss of natural forests worldwide, resulting in forest fragmentation, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and carbon loss. In response to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, particularly the Global Forest Goals, China implemented a series of large-scale ecological restoration programs. In the context of coexisting forest restoration and forest loss, the effectiveness of long-term forest ecological restoration programs in optimizing forest fragmentation remains uncertain. Within the framework of long-term ecological restoration programs, we investigate the dynamics of forest fragmentation, analyze the spatial processes of forest expansion and loss, and assess the impact of forest fragmentation on core and edge forests in Panzhihua City using landscape metrics and Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis. At the statistical scale, the rise in AI and CONTAG indices, along with the decline in the SHDI index, signifies a reduction in forest fragmentation. Additionally, the findings of the Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) at the spatial scale corroborate this trend. These results demonstrate that long-term ecological restoration programs reduced forest fragmentation, primarily driven by forest expansion. We discovered that forest fragmentation decreased thanks to three ecological management practices: (1) expanding forest edges (sprawl); (2) converting farmland on the forest's edge to forestland (corridor or sprawl); and (3) closing perforations within forests (infill). Additionally, at the spatial pattern level, the reduction of forest fragmentation enhanced the core forest area (567.36 km2) and declined edge forest area (44.28 km2) in Panzhihua City from 1992 to 2020. Integrating the MSPA analysis with landscape indices enhances our understanding of landscape fragmentation in the region. Considering spatial complexity when analyzing the spatial processes of forest expansion and loss holds significant importance for formulating improvement strategies. Moreover, these findings emphasize the necessity of considering the spatial process of forest expansion while formulating effective forest restoration measures to mitigate fragmentation and minimize the negative impact of edge effects on forests.

AB Responding to growing criticism that the use of artificial intelligence in public services reinforces unethical activities such as discrimination, the paper presents two new cases from the cities in Finland, both self-describing as centres for the ethical use of AI. Structured by an ethical AI foresighting framework we explore how and why AI is being used in local public services and its outcomes, the degree to which current AI-enabled public services are ethically evaluated and whether ethical evaluation features in trends for future AI use.The research objectives are to demonstrate how AI is being deployed in cities claiming to be European centres for ethical AI use, to innovate new service models and to present a new framework, based on social learning to help analysis of ethics in AI-related innovation processes, in particular those enhancing accountability to citizens. In doing so, we show in practical terms how ethical decision-making processes are identified and responded to addressing explainability and understandability issues.We suggest that negative ethical results from AI use can be avoided, however this requires an ethos of citizen involvement in innovation processes and significant investment in times and attention to distribute learning and opinions between providers, technical partners and service users include an acknowledgment that technical partners learn from users as well as users learning from technical partners.

AB The practice of oncology requires analyzing and synthesizing abundant data. From the patient's workup to determine eligibility to the therapies received to the post-treatment surveillance, practitioners must constantly juggle, evaluate, and weigh decision-making based on their best understanding of information at hand. These complex, multifactorial decisions have a tremendous opportunity to benefit from data-driven machine learning (ML) methods to drive opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Within the past 5 years, we have seen AI move from simply a promising opportunity to being used in prospective trials. Here, we review recent efforts of AI in clinical trials that have moved the needle towards improved prediction of actionable outcomes, such as predicting acute care visits, short term mortality, and pathologic extranodal extension. We then pause and reflect on how these AI models ask a different question than traditional statistics models that read-ers may be more familiar with; how then should readers conceptualize and interpret AI models that they are not as familiar with. We end with what we believe are promising future opportunities for AI in oncology, with an eye towards allowing the data to inform us through unsupervised learning and generative models, rather than asking AI to perform specific functions.

TI Evaluation of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in luminal breast cancer
   using artificial intelligence
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID PROGNOSTIC VALUE; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; TILS; CHEMOTHERAPY; RECEPTOR; TRIAL
AB BackgroundTumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a prognostic parameter in triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC). However, their role in luminal (oestrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative (ER + /HER2-)) BC remains unclear. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) to assess the prognostic significance of TILs in a large well-characterised cohort of luminal BC.MethodsSupervised deep learning model analysis of Haematoxylin and Eosin (H & E)-stained whole slide images (WSI) was applied to a cohort of 2231 luminal early-stage BC patients with long-term follow-up. Stromal TILs (sTILs) and intratumoural TILs (tTILs) were quantified and their spatial distribution within tumour tissue, as well as the proportion of stroma involved by sTILs were assessed. The association of TILs with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome was determined.ResultsA strong positive linear correlation was observed between sTILs and tTILs. High sTILs and tTILs counts, as well as their proximity to stromal and tumour cells (co-occurrence) were associated with poor clinical outcomes and unfavourable clinicopathological parameters including high tumour grade, lymph node metastasis, large tumour size, and young age. AI-based assessment of the proportion of stroma composed of sTILs (as assessed visually in routine practice) was not predictive of patient outcome. tTILs was an independent predictor of worse patient outcome in multivariate Cox Regression analysis.ConclusionAI-based detection of TILs counts, and their spatial distribution provides prognostic value in luminal early-stage BC patients. The utilisation of AI algorithms could provide a comprehensive assessment of TILs as a morphological variable in WSIs beyond eyeballing assessment.

AB INTRODUCTIONExperimental models are essential tools in neurodegenerative disease research. However, the translation of insights and drugs discovered in model systems has proven immensely challenging, marred by high failure rates in human clinical trials.METHODSHere we review the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in experimental medicine for dementia research.RESULTSConsidering the specific challenges of reproducibility and translation between other species or model systems and human biology in preclinical dementia research, we highlight best practices and resources that can be leveraged to quantify and evaluate translatability. We then evaluate how AI and ML approaches could be applied to enhance both cross-model reproducibility and translation to human biology, while sustaining biological interpretability.DISCUSSIONAI and ML approaches in experimental medicine remain in their infancy. However, they have great potential to strengthen preclinical research and translation if based upon adequate, robust, and reproducible experimental data.HighlightsThere are increasing applications of AI in experimental medicine.We identified issues in reproducibility, cross-species translation, and data curation in the field.Our review highlights data resources and AI approaches as solutions.Multi-omics analysis with AI offers exciting future possibilities in drug discovery.

ID PREVALENCE
AB Introduction: Numerous studies have demonstrated the use of Artificial Intelligence for early detection of referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR). A direct comparison of these multiple Automated DR Image Assessment Softwares(ARIA) is however challenging. We retrospectively compared the performance of two modern ARIAs, IDx-DR and Medios AI.Methods: In this retrospective-comparative study, retinal images with sufficient image quality were run on both ARIAs. They were captured in 811 consecutive patients with Diabetes visiting diabetic clinics in Poland. For each patient, four non-mydriatic images, 45-degree field of view i.e two sets of one optic disc and one macula-centered image using Topcon NW400 were captured. Images were manually graded for severity of DR as no DR, any DR (mild NPDR or more severe disease), RDR (moderate NPDR or more severe disease and/or clinically significant diabetic macular edema (CSDME)) or sight-threatening DR (severe NPDR or more severe disease and/or CSDME) by certified graders. The ARIAs output was compared to manual consensus image grading (reference standard).Results: On 807 patients, based on consensus grading, there was no evidence of DR in 543 patients (67). Any DR was seen in 264 (33%) patients, of which 174 (22%) were referable DR, and 41 (5%) sight-threatening DR. The sensitivity of detecting RDR against reference standard grading was 95% (95%CI 91, 98%) and the specificity was 80% (95%CI 77, 83%) for Medios AI. They were 99% (95%CI 96, 100%) and 68% (95%CI 64, 72%) for IDx-DR respectively.Conclusion: Both the ARIAs achieved satisfactory accuracy, with few false negatives. Although false-positive results generate additional costs and workload, missed cases raise the most concern whenever automated screening is debated.

AB The potential effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on the teaching of anatomy are unclear. We explore the hypothetical situation of human body donors being replaced by AI human body simulations and reflect on two separate ethical concerns: first, whether it is permissible to replace donors with AI human body simulations in the dissection room when the consequences of doing so are unclear, and second, the overarching ethical significance of AI use in anatomy education. To do this, we highlight the key benefits of student exposure to the dissection room and body donors, including nontechnical, discipline-independent skills, awareness and interaction with applied bioethics, and professional identity formation. We suggest that the uniqueness of the dissection room experience and the importance of the key benefits accompanying this exposure outweigh the potential and so far unknown benefits of AI technology in this space. Further, the lack of engagement with bioethical principles that are intimately intertwined with the dissection room experience may have repercussions for future healthcare professional development. We argue that interaction with body donors must be protected and maintained and not replaced with AI human body donor simulations. Any move away from this foundation of anatomy education requires scrutiny. In light of the possible adoption of AI technologies into anatomy teaching, it is necessary that medical educators reflect on the dictum that the practice of healthcare, and anatomy, is a uniquely human endeavor.

   segmentation
ID ENDOBRONCHIAL VALVES; LOBAR PERFUSION; PLANAR IMAGES; VENTILATION
AB Background: Lung lobar ventilation and perfusion ( V/Q) quantification is generally obtained by generating planar scintigraphy images and then imposing three equally sized regions of interest on the data of each lung. This method is fast but not as accurate as SPECT/CT imaging, which provides three-dimensional data and therefore allows more precise lobar quantification. However, the manual delineation of each lobe is time-consuming, which makes SPECT/CT incompatible with the clinical workflow for V/Q estimation. An alternative may be to use artificial intelligence-based autosegmentation tools such as AutoLung3D (Siemens Healthineers, Knoxville, USA), which automatically delineate the lung lobes on the CT data acquired with the SPECT data. The present study assessed the clinical validity of this approach relative to planar scintigraphy and manual quantification in SPECT/CT.
   Methods: The Autolung3D software was tested on the retrospective SPECT/CT data of 43 patients who underwent V/Q scintigraphy with Tc-99m-macroaggregated albumin and Tc-99m-labeled aerosol. It was compared to planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT using the manual quantification method in terms of relative lobar V/Q quantification values and interobserver variability.
   Results: The three methods provided similar V/Q estimates for the left lung lobes and total lungs. However, compared to the manual SPECT/CT method, planar scintigraphy yielded significantly higher estimates for the middle right lobe and significantly lower estimates for the superior and inferior right lobes. The estimates of the manual and automated SPECT/CT methods were similar. However, the post-processing time in the automated method was approximately 5 min compared to 2 h for the manual method. Moreover, the automated method associated with a drastic reduction in inter-observer variability: Its maximal relative standard deviation was only 5%, compared to 23% for planar scintigraphy and 19% for the manual SPECT/CT method.
   Conclusions: This study validated the AutoLung3D software for general clinical use since it rapidly provides accurate lobar quantification in V/Q scans with markedly less interobserver variability than planar scintigraphy or the manual SPECT/CT method.

AB PurposeTo analyze the global publications on artificial intelligence (AI) in strabismus using a bibliometric approach.MethodsThe Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database was used to retrieve all of the publications on AI in strabismus from 2002 to 2023. We analyzed the publication and citation trend and identified highly-cited articles, prolific countries, institutions, authors and journals, relevant research domains and keywords. VOSviewer (software) and Bibliometrix (package) were used for data analysis and visualization.ResultsBy analyzing a total of 146 relevant publications, this study found an overall increasing trend in the number of annual publications and citations in the last decade. USA was the most productive country with the closest international cooperation. The top 3 research domains were Ophthalmology, Engineering Biomedical and Optics. Journal of AAPOS was the most productive journal in this field. The keywords analysis showed that "deep learning" and "machine learning" may be the hotspots in the future.ConclusionIn recent years, research on the application of AI in strabismus has made remarkable progress. The future trends will be toward optimized technology and algorithms. Our findings help researchers better understand the development of this field and provide valuable clues for future research directions.

AB Introduction: Indigenous people experience health disparities, including higher rates of substance use disorders (SUDs). Digital therapeutics are a growing platform for treatment services and have the potential to expand access to culturally responsive interventions for Indigenous people. As one of the first randomized controlled trials for SUDs for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults, the aim of this study was to pilot test the efficacy of a culturally tailored intervention among urban Indigenous adults. Methods: The study used a randomized controlled parallel design of 12 weeks of treatment-as-usual (TAU) (n = 26) versus TAU + Therapeutic Education System-Native Version (TES-NAV) (n = 27) with follow-up assessments at end of treatment and week 24 in an urban outpatient addiction treatment program for Native American adults. TAU consisted of individual/group counseling and cultural activities. The TES-NAV arm comprised TAU + 26 self-directed culturally tailored digital skills-based modules grounded in the community reinforcement approach with contingency management for abstinence and module completion. Primary outcome was longest consecutive weeks of abstinence from drugs and heavy drinking measured using self-report (Timeline Followback) and urine alcohol and drug toxicology screen during 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes were percent days abstinence during and posttreatment, coping strategies, social connectedness, and substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Results: The study enrolled fifty-three (52.8 % male) AI/AN adults seeking treatment for a SUD. Although the study did not detect a benefit of TAU+TES-NAV over TAU on the primary outcome (Median = 2 consecutive weeks of abstinence for both arms) at end of treatment (treatment effect: Z = -0.78, p = 0.437), TAU+TES-NAV participants did demonstrate significantly greater percent days of abstinence at the week 24 follow-up (69.3 % versus 49.0 % for TAU; t = 2.08, p = 0.045) and significantly greater change in social connectedness mean score, baseline to week 12 (Z = -2.66, p = 0.011), compared to TAU. The study detected no differences between treatment arms for coping strategies or risk behaviors. Conclusion: The addition of TES-NAV to TAU did not significantly improve consecutive weeks of abstinence from drugs or heavy drinking; however, several secondary findings suggest promise for a culturally tailored digital therapeutic SUD intervention among urban Indigenous people.

AB The abundance of artificial intelligence AI algorithms and growing computing power has brought a disruptive revolution to the smart medical industry. Its powerful data abstraction and representation capabilities enable the modeling of hundreds of millions of medical data, such as sub-Computed Tomography tumor identification, retinal lesion screening, and survival curve analysis. However, all of these applications demonstrate AI's use of unimodal data for specific tasks. In contrast, clinicians deal with multi-modal data from multiple sources when diagnosing, performing prognostic assessments, and deciding on treatment plans. These requirements have facilitated the development of multi-modal AI solutions and improved the performance of AI models in handling complex medical scenarios and data. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of the art and research in multi-modal biomedical AI, including applications, data, methods, and analytics. Additionally, we summarize potential research directions for multi-modal AI technologies in the future of healthcare.

AB Edge-AI uses Artificial Intelligence algorithms directly embedded on a device, contrary to a remote AI that uses an AI on a cloud or remote server for prediction. Recent improvements in microcontroller computing capabilities and enhanced deep learning algorithms and conversion frameworks made it easier to run small AI models directly on microcontroller units. Is the current interest in on-device AI justified in terms of its energy consumption on resource -constrained devices when compared to AI on the cloud? This study presents how an embedded deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for real-time human activity recognition with more than 98% classification accuracy and its impact on battery life. Experiments conducted on a triaxial accelerometer with data collected and processed by an ARM Cortex-M4 -based development board showed that energy consumption could be reduced up to 21% when inferences are run on an edge device versus using a remote server/cloud without compromising the overall classification precision and accuracy. We can reduce energy consumption by limiting data transmission by considering pseudo-real-time or non-real-time application scenarios.

While toolkits for individual parts of this workflow exist, a solution that provides integration of all steps is rarely found. We present the Diagnostic Expert Advisor, a platform for machine learning research on heterogeneous medical time-series data that aims to provide a robust environment for the rapid development of AI applications. It integrates a local web app through which whole patient cohorts, as well as the disease evolution of individual patients, can be analyzed with integrated tools for data handling, visualization, and parallelization.

ID HAEMATOBIUM INFECTION
AB In this research, we report on the performance of automated optical digital detection and quantification of Schistosoma haematobium provided by AiDx NTDx multi-diagnostic Assist microscope. Our study was community-based, and a convenient sampling method was used in 17 communities in Abuja Nigeria, based on the disease prevalence information extracted from the baseline database on schistosomiasis, NTD Division, of the Federal Ministry of Health. At baseline, samples from 869 participants were evaluated of which 358 (34.1%) tested S. haematobium positive by the reference diagnostic standard. Registered images from the fully automated (autofocusing, scanning, image registration and processing, AI image analysis and automatic parasite count) AiDx assist microscope were analyzed. The Semi automated (autofocusing, scanning, image registration & processing and manual parasite count) and the fully automated AiDx Assist showed comparable sensitivities and specificities of [90.3%, 98%] and [89%, 99%] respectively. Overall, estimated egg counts of the semi-automated & fully automated AiDx Assist correlated significantly with the egg counts of conventional microscopy (r = 0.93, p & LE; 0.001 and r = 0.89, p & LE; 0.001 respectively). The AiDx Assist device performance is consistent with requirement of the World Health Organization diagnostic target product profile for monitoring, evaluation, and surveillance of Schistosomiasis elimination Programs.

AB This study numerically investigated the effect of applying different shapes of nanofluid-conveying pipes on a thermal solar panel system. Two pipes with circular, elliptical, and square shapes were employed in this system. Likewise, paraffin wax Phase Change Material (PCM) was used in the solar thermal panel. A large number of spherical pin fins were installed over the pipes inside the PCM. The two phases of the NF were simulated, and all equations were solved using an element-free Galerkin method based on weak form. The results showed that the elliptical pipes increased the volume of the liquid PCM around them, while the circular pipes raised the quantity of solid PCM around them. That is to say, these two pipe types brought about the maximum difference in the volume of the phase change material (5%). When t = 2000 s, the temperature could decrease by >1% through circular rather than elliptical pipes. In the same period, the heat transfer rate of the circular pipes was 16.17% above that of elliptical pipes, whose heat transfer was 48.43% higher compared to the square pipes. When the solar panel was hot, elliptical pipes maximized the temperature of the output NF, and circular pipes minimized the NF's temperature at the outlet.

ID EXTRACTION
AB In this paper, we propose a Legal Rule Classification (LRC) task using one of the most discussed language model in the field of Artificial Intelligence, namely GPT-3, a generative pretrained language model. We train and test the proposed LRC task on the GDPR encoded in LegalDocML ( Palmirani and Vitali, 2011 ) and LegalRuleML ( Athan et al., 2013 ), two widely used XML standards for the legal domain. We use the LegalDocML and LegalRuleML annotations provided in Robaldo et al. (2020) to fine-tuned GPT-3. While showing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to easily learn to classify legal and deontic rules even on small amount of data, we show that GPT-3 can significantly outperform previous experiments on the same task. Our work focused on a multiclass task, showing that GPT-3 is capable to recognize the difference between obligation rules, permission rules and constitutive rules with performances that overcome previous scores in LRC.

TI ChatAgri: Exploring potentials of ChatGPT on cross-linguistic

DE Agricultural text classification; Very large pre-trained language model;
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT); ChatGPT; GPT-4
AB In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a vast amount of agricultural news text is posted online, accu-mulating significant agricultural knowledge. To efficiently access this knowledge, effective text classification techniques are urgently needed. Deep learning approaches, such as fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have shown remarkable performance gains. Nonetheless, these methods face several complex challenges, including limited agricultural training data, poor domain transferability (especially across languages), and complex and expensive deployment of large models. Inspired by the success of recent ChatGPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), this work explores the potential of applying ChatGPT in the field of agricultural informatization. Various crucial factors, such as prompt construction, answer parsing, and different ChatGPT variants, are thoroughly investigated to maximize its capabilities. A preliminary comparative study is conducted, comparing ChatGPT with PLMs-based fine-tuning methods and PLMs-based prompt-tuning methods. Empirical results demonstrate that ChatGPT effectively addresses the mentioned research challenges and bottlenecks, making it an ideal solution for agricultural text classification. Moreover, ChatGPT achieves comparable performance to existing PLM-based fine-tuning methods, even without fine-tuning on agricultural data samples. We hope this preliminary study could inspire the emergence of a general-purpose AI paradigm for agricultural text processing.

AB Fixed-timed artificial insemination (FTAI) protocols for beef cattle in South America are primarily based on estradiol esters and intravaginal progesterone-releasing devices (IVPD). The objective of this study was to determine the optimal gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-based protocol as an alternative to the use of estrogen-based protocols in grazing Bos taurus suckling beef cows. All cows received an IVPD on the day of protocol initiation and prostaglandin F-2 alpha (PG) plus equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) treatments at the time of IVPD removal. In Experiment 1, cows (n = 235) were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (i) 7-day estradiol = 2 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB) at IVPD insertion on Day 9 and 1 mg of estradiol cypionate (ECP) at IVPD removal on Day 2; (ii) 7-day GnRH = 10 mu g of GnRH at IVPD insertion on Day 10, IVPD removal on Day 3 and GnRH at FTAI; (iii) 7 & 7 estradiol = PG at IVPD insertion on Day 16, EB on Day 9 and ECP at IVPD removal on Day 2; (iv) 7 & 7 GnRH = PG at IVPD insertion on Day 17, GnRH on Day 10, IVPD removal on Day 3 and GnRH at FTAI. In Experiment 2, cows (n = 462) were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (i) 6-day estradiol = EB at IVPD insertion on Day 9, IVPD removal on Day 3 and GnRH at FTAI; (ii) 7-day estradiol; (iii) 7-day GnRH; (iv) 7 & 7 GnRH. In Experiment 1, plasma progesterone concentrations and percentage of cows with a corpus luteum (CL) at IVPD removal, and pregnancy per AI (P/AI) were greater for cows subjected to GnRH-based protocols compared with cows subjected to estrogen-based protocols (p < 0.01). In Experiment 2, cows subjected to the 7 & 7 GnRH protocol had the greatest P/AI (p < 0.01). In summary, GnRH-based FTAI protocols resulted in similar or greater P/AI compared to estrogen-based FTAI protocols in grazing postpartum Bos taurus suckled beef cows. The greatest P/AI was attained with the 7 & 7 GnRH protocol.

AB Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition whose prevalence has significantly increased. This work proposes the development of a severity index to classify patients from symptoms, mainly motor ones, using an Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) trained by the Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) algorithm. The FOX Insight database was used, which offers data in the form of questionnaires answered by patients or caregivers from all over the world, with information regarding this pathology. After pre-processing the data, a set of 597 questionnaires containing 28 defined questions was selected. The symptoms were individually analyzed after mapping and divided into four classes. In class 1, most symptoms were not present. In class 2, the presence of certain symptoms demonstrated early milestones of the disease. In class 3, symptoms related to the patient's mobility, in particular pain, stand out among the most reported. In class 4, the intense presence of all symptoms is observed. To test the tool, data were used from some of these patients, who answered the same questionnaire at different times (simulating medical appointments). The presented severity index to classify patients allowed identifying the current stage of the disease allowing the follow-up. This AI-based decision-support tool can help medical professionals to predict the evolution of Parkinson's disease, which can result in longer life quality of patients, in terms of symptoms and medication requirements.

AB The ratio of students with a multicultural background relative to the total number of students in South Korea is consistently going up due to the increasing number of multicultural students and decreasing school age population. Yet, the low level of digitalization in multicultural households requires an effort to address digital divide. This paper, accordingly, held an SW (software) and AI (artificial intelligence) camp on four occasions to 314 multicultural students living in Jeju and observed how the perception of participating students changed on SW and AI. The education camp was organized after analyzing the limitations of existing multicultural education and computer education as well as their issues. To validate effects of the education, a paired sample t-test before and after education and an independent sample t-test were carried out to make an analysis by education period and analyze education effect by background variables. Furthermore, text network analysis on short answers was made for an in-depth analysis of research results. It shows the research participants' awareness of SW center dot AI changing for the positive post-camp in most sub-elements. However, selfefficacy of jobs related to SW center dot AI, which was one of the sub-elements, was lower post-camp than in pre-camp in a few cases. Since the average score of this particular element is noticeably lower than other average scores and research participants were not evenly distributed by grade, further improvement is warranted in follow-up research.

AB Particulate matter (PM) pollution is a major global concern due to its negative impact on human health. To effectively address this issue, it is crucial to have a reliable and efficient forecasting system. In this study, we propose a framework for predicting particulate matter concentrations by utilizing publicly available data from low-cost sensors and deep learning. We model the temporal variability through a novel Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network that offers a level of interpretability. The spatial dependence of particulate matter pollution in urban areas is modeled by incorporating characteristics of the urban agglomeration, namely, mean population density and mean floor area ratio. Our approach is general and scalable, as it can be applied to any type of sensor. Moreover, our framework allows for portable sensors, either mounted on vehicles or used by people. We demonstrate its effectiveness through a case study in Greece, where dense urban environments combined with low cost sensor networks is a peculiarity. Specifically, we consider Patras, a Greek port city, where the net PM pollution comes from a variety of sources, including traffic, port activity and domestic heating. Our model achieves a forecasting accuracy comparable to the resolution of the sensors and provides meaningful insights into the results.

AB Colon cancer is the third most common cancer type worldwide in 2020, almost two million cases were diagnosed. As a result, providing new, highly accurate techniques in detecting colon cancer leads to early and successful treatment of this disease. This paper aims to propose a heterogenic stacking deep learning model to predict colon cancer. Stacking deep learning is integrated with pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models with a metalearner to enhance colon cancer prediction performance. The proposed model is compared with VGG16, InceptionV3, Resnet50, and DenseNet121 using different evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the proposed models are evaluated using the LC25000 and WCE binary and muticlassified colon cancer image datasets. The results show that the stacking models recorded the highest performance for the two datasets. For the LC25000 dataset, the stacked model recorded the highest performance accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score (100). For the WCE colon image dataset, the stacked model recorded the highest performance accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score (98). Stacking-SVM achieved the highest performed compared to existing models (VGG16, InceptionV3, Resnet50, and DenseNet121) because it combines the output of multiple single models and trains and evaluates a metalearner using the output to produce better predictive results than any single model. Black-box deep learning models are represented using explainable AI (XAI).

AB Obtaining precise solar radiation data is the first stage in determining the availability of solar energy. It is also regarded as one of the major inputs for a variety of solar applications. Due to the scarcity of solar radiation measurement data for many locations throughout the world, many solar radiation models are utilized to predict global solar radiation. Indeed, the most widely used AI technique is artificial neural networks (ANNs). Hitherto, while ANNs have been utilized in various studies to estimate global solar radiation (GSR), limited attention has been given to the architecture of ANN. Thus, this study aimed to: first, optimize the design of one of the faster and most used machine-learning (ML) algorithms, the ANN, to forecast GSR more accurately while saving computation power; second, optimize the number of neurons in the hidden layer to obtain the most significant ANN model for accurate GSR estimation, since it is still lacking; in addition to investigating the impact of varying the number of neurons in the hidden layer on the proficiency of the ANN-based model to predict GSR with high accuracy; and, finally, conduct a comparative study between the ANN and empirical techniques for estimating GSR. The results showed that the best ANN model and the empirical model provided an excellent estimation for the GSR, with a Coefficient of Determination R-2 greater than 0.98%. Additionally, ANN architectures with a smaller number of neurons in the single hidden layer (1-3 neurons) provided the best performance, with R-2 > 0.98%. Furthermore, the performance of the developed ANN models remained approximately stable and excellent when the number of hidden layer's neurons was less than ten neurons (R-2 > 0.97%), as their performance was very close to each other. However, the ANN models experienced performance instability when the number of hidden layer's neurons exceeded nine neurons. Furthermore, the performance comparison between the best ANN-based model and the empirical one revealed that both models performed well (R-2 > 0.98%). Moreover, while the relative error for the best ANN model slightly exceeded the range, +/- 10% in November and December, it remained within the range for the empirical model even in the winter months. Additionally, the obtained results of the best ANN model in this work were compared with the recent related work. While it had a good RMSE value of 0.8361 MJ/m(2) day(-1) within the ranges of previous work, its correlation coefficient (r) was the best one. Therefore, the developed models in this study can be utilized for accurate GSR forecasting. The accurate and efficient estimation of global solar radiation using both models can be valuable in designing and performance evaluation for different solar applications.

AB In the evolving landscape of targeted marketing, integrating deep learning (DL) and explainable AI (XAI) offers a promising avenue for enhanced customer segmentation. This paper introduces a groundbreaking approach, DeepLimeSeg, which synergizes DL methodologies with Lime-based Explainability to segment customers effectively. The approach employs a comprehensive mathematical model to harness demographic data, behavioral patterns, and purchase histories, categorizing customers into distinct clusters aligned with their preferences and needs. A pivotal component of this research is the mathematical underpinning of the DeepLimeSeg approach. The Lime-based Explainability module ensures that the segmentation results are accurate and interpretable. The mathematical rigor facilitates businesses tailoring their marketing strategies with precision, optimizing sales outcomes. To validate the efficacy of DeepLimeSeg, we employed two real-world datasets: Mall-Customer Segmentation Data and an E-Commerce dataset. A comparative analysis between DeepLimeSeg and the traditional Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis is presented. The RFM analysis, grounded in its mathematical modeling, segments customers based on purchase recency, frequency, and monetary value. Our preprocessing involved computing RFM scores for each customer, followed by K-means clustering to delineate customer segments. Empirical results underscored the superiority of DeepLimeSeg over other models in terms of MSE, MAE, and R2 metrics. Specifically, the model registered an MSE of 0.9412, indicative of its robust predictive accuracy concerning the spending score. The MAE value stood at 0.9874, signifying minimal deviation from actual values. This paper accentuates the importance of mathematical modeling in enhancing customer segmentation. The DeepLimeSeg approach, with its mathematical foundation and explainable AI integration, paves the way for businesses to make informed, data-driven marketing decisions.

AB Standardized radiological reports stimulate debate in the medical imaging field. This review paper explores the advantages and challenges of standardized reporting. Standardized reporting can offer improved clarity and efficiency of communication among radiologists and the multidisciplinary team. However, challenges include limited flexibility, initially increased time and effort, and potential user experience issues. The efforts toward standardization are examined, encompassing the establishment of reporting templates, use of common imaging lexicons, and integration of clinical decision support tools. Recent technological advancements, including multimedia-enhanced reporting and AI-driven solutions, are discussed for their potential to improve the standardization process. Organizations such as the ACR, ESUR, RSNA, and ESR have developed standardized reporting systems, templates, and platforms to promote uniformity and collaboration. However, challenges remain in terms of workflow adjustments, language and format variability, and the need for validation. The review concludes by presenting a set of ten essential rules for creating standardized radiology reports, emphasizing clarity, consistency, and adherence to structured formats.

AB Moderate red wine intake has been associated with lower cardiovascular mortality, due in part to the intake of polyphenols and anthocyanins, whose content can vary from varietal and year of harvest. This study assessed the vascular effects in response to a single intake of 2015 and 2018 Zweigelt red wines from Hokkaido, Japan. Healthy men were randomly assigned to consume 240 mL each of a red wine, or a sparkling white grape juice as a control in a randomized three-arm cross-over design with a 7 day washout between arms. The augmentation index (AI; a measure of arterial stiffness) and AI at 75 beats/min (AI75), reactive hyperemia index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), and platelet reactivity were assessed at baseline and two and four hours after each beverage intake. Changes from the baseline were analyzed using a linear mixed model. Significant treatment effects (p = 0.02) were observed, with AI 13% lower after the intake of the 2015 or 2018 vintages compared to the control. Intake of the 2018 vintage reduced SBP and DBP (-4.1 mmHg and -5.6 mmHg, respectively; p = 0.02) compared to the 2015 wine and the control drink. The amount of hydroxytyrosol in the 2018 wine was almost twice the amount as in the 2015 wine, which may help explain the variable blood pressure results.

AB Carbon emissions have gained worldwide attention in the industrial era. As a key carbon-emitting industry, achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the manufacturing sector is vital to mitigating the negative effects of climate change and achieving sustainable development. The rise of intelligent technologies has driven industrial structural transformations that may help achieve carbon reduction. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is an important part of digitalization, providing new technological tools and directions for the low carbon development of enterprises. This study selects Chinese A-share listed companies in the manufacturing industry from 2012 to 2021 as the research objects and uses a fixed-effects regression model to study the relationship between AI and carbon emissions. This study clarifies the significance of enterprise AI technology applications in realizing carbon emissions reduction and explores the regulatory mechanism from the perspective of the innovation effect. The results show that the application of enterprise AI technology positively impacts carbon emissions reduction. Simultaneously, green technological innovation, green management innovation, and green product innovation play moderating roles; in other words, enterprise green innovation strengthens the effect of AI on carbon emissions reduction. This study clarifies the necessity of intelligent manufacturing and enriches theories related to AI technology and carbon emissions.

AB The advancement of generative AI technologies underscores the need for AI literacy, particularly in Southeast Asia's elementary Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) education. This study explores the development of AI literacy principles for elementary students. Utilizing existing AI literacy models, a three-session classroom intervention was implemented in an Indonesian school, grounded in constructivist, constructionist, and transformative learning theories. Through design-based research (DBR) and network analysis of reflection papers (n = 77), the intervention was evaluated and redesigned. Findings revealed clusters of interdependent elements of learner experiences, categorized into successes, struggles, and alignments with learning theories. These were translated into design moves for future intervention iterations, forming design principles for AI literacy development. The study contributes insights into optimizing the positive effects and minimizing the negative impacts of AI in education.

AB Differentiated production and supply chain management (SCM) areas benefit from the IoT, Big Data, and the data-management capabilities of the AI paradigm. Many businesses have wondered how the arrival of AI will affect planning, organization, optimization, and logistics in the context of SCM. Information symmetry is very important here, as maintaining consistency between output and the supply chain is aided by processing and drawing insights from big data. We consider continuous (production) and discontinuous (supply chain) data to satisfy delivery needs to solve the shortage problem. Despite a surplus of output, this article addresses the voluptuous deficiency problem in supply chain administration. This research serves as an overview of AI for SCM practitioners. The report then moves into an in-depth analysis of the most recent studies on and applications of AI in the supply chain industry. This work introduces a novel approach, Incessant Data Processing (IDP), for handling harmonized data on both ends, which should reduce the risk of incorrect results. This processing technique detects shifts in the data stream and uses them to predict future suppressions of demand. Federated learning gathers and analyzes information at several points in the supply chain and is used to spot the shifts. The learning model is educated to forecast further supply chain actions in response to spikes and dips in demand. The entire procedure is simulated using IoT calculations and collected data. An improved prediction accuracy of 9.93%, a reduced analysis time of 9.19%, a reduced data error of 9.77%, and increased alterations of 10.62% are the results of the suggested method.

AB Introduction: American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are disproportionately affected by substance use disorders (SUDs) and related health disparities in contrast to other ethnoracial groups in the United States. Over the past 20 years, substantial resources have been allocated to the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN) to disseminate and implement effective SUD treatments in communities. However, we know little about how these resources have benefitted AI/AN peoples with SUD who arguably experience the greatest burden of SUDs. This review aims to determine lessons learned about AI/AN substance use and treatment outcomes in the CTN and the role of racism and Tribal identity. Method: We conducted a scoping review informed by the Joanna Briggs framework and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and explanation. The study team conducted the search strategy within the CTN Dissemination Library and nine additional databases for articles published between 2000 and 2021. The review included studies if they reported results for AI/AN participants. Two reviewers determined study eligibility. Results: A systematic search yielded 13 empirical articles and six conceptual articles. Themes from the 13 empirical articles included: (1) Tribal Identity: Race, Culture, and Discrimination; (2) Treatment Engagement: Access and Retention; (3) Comorbid Conditions; (4) HIV/Risky Sexual Behaviors; and (5) Dissemination. The most salient theme was Tribal Identity: Race, Culture, and Discrimination, which was present in all articles that included a primary AI/AN sample (k = 8). Themes assessed but not identified for AI/AN peoples were Harm Reduction, Measurement Equivalence, Pharmacotherapy, and Substance Use Outcomes. The conceptual contributions used AI/AN CTN studies as exemplars of community-based and Tribal participatory research (CBPR/ TPR). Conclusion: CTN studies conducted with AI/AN communities demonstrate culturally congruent methods, including CBPR/TPR strategies; consideration/assessment of cultural identity, racism, and discrimination; and CBPR/TPR informed dissemination plans. Although important efforts are underway to increase AI/AN participation in the CTN, future research would benefit from strategies to increase participation of this population. Such strategies include reporting AI/AN subgroup data; addressing issues of cultural identity and experiences of racism; and adopting an overall effort for research aimed at understanding barriers to treatment access, engagement, utilization, retention, and outcomes for both treatment and research disparities for AI/AN populations.

AB The emergence of new prestigious professions in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) provide a rare opportunity to explore the gendered dynamics of technical careers as they are being formed. In this paper, we contribute to the literature on gender inequality in digital work by curating and analysing a unique cross-country data set. We use innovative data science methodology to investigate the nature of work and skills in these under-researched fields. Our research finds persistent disparities in jobs, qualifications, seniority, industry, attrition and even self-confidence in these fields. We identify structural inequality in data and AI, with career trajectories of professionals differentiated by gender, reflecting the broader history of computing. Our work is original in illuminating gendering processes within elite high-tech jobs as they are being configured. Paying attention to these nascent fields is crucial if we are to ensure that women take their rightful place at forefront of technological innovation.

AB Crop rotation planning is the process of deciding the types and the temporal succession of plants on agricultural areas to increase soil quality, crop yield, and pest/weed resistance. The data sources and modalities available for crop rotation planning are very diverse and the domain lacks solely data-driven approaches. In this paper we used literature-and NDVI-measurement-based successor crop suitability matrices and crop-specific attributes such as contribution margin and nitrogen demand as input for training an DQN-based reinforcement learning agent to generate crop rotation sequences. Practitioners and crop rotation experts validated the generated crop rotation sequences and concluded that most of the sequences are realistic, comply with existing crop rotation rule sets, and can be applied in practice.

AB Objective Applications of machine learning in healthcare are of high interest and have the potential to improve patient care. Yet, the real-world accuracy of these models in clinical practice and on different patient subpopulations remains unclear. To address these important questions, we hosted a community challenge to evaluate methods that predict healthcare outcomes. We focused on the prediction of all-cause mortality as the community challenge question. Materials and methods Using a Model-to-Data framework, 345 registered participants, coalescing into 25 independent teams, spread over 3 continents and 10 countries, generated 25 accurate models all trained on a dataset of over 1.1 million patients and evaluated on patients prospectively collected over a 1-year observation of a large health system. Results The top performing team achieved a final area under the receiver operator curve of 0.947 (95% CI, 0.942-0.951) and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.487 (95% CI, 0.458-0.499) on a prospectively collected patient cohort. Discussion Post hoc analysis after the challenge revealed that models differ in accuracy on subpopulations, delineated by race or gender, even when they are trained on the same data. Conclusion This is the largest community challenge focused on the evaluation of state-of-the-art machine learning methods in a healthcare system performed to date, revealing both opportunities and pitfalls of clinical AI.

AB Background: Tiered trauma triage systems have resulted in a significant mortality reduction, but models have remained unchanged. The aim of this study was to develop and test an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict critical care resource utilization.
   Methods: We queried the ACS-TQIP 2017-18 database for truncal gunshot wounds(GSW). An information-aware deep neural network (DNN-IAD) model was trained to predict ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation (MV). Input variables included demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, and external injuries. The model's performance was assessed using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).
   Results: For the ICU admission analysis, we included 39,916 patients. For the MV need analysis, 39,591 patients were included. Median (IQR) age was 27 (22,36). AUROC and AUPRC for predicting ICU need were 84.8 +/- 0.5 and 75.4 +/- 0.5, and the AUROC and AUPRC for MV need were 86.8 +/- 0.5 and 72.5 +/- 0.6.
   Conclusions: Our model predicts hospital utilization outcomes in patients with truncal GSW with high accuracy, allowing early resource mobilization and rapid triage decisions in hospitals with capacity issues and austere environments.

AB Electronic packaging technology undergoes Accelerated Thermal Cycling Test (ACTC) before hitting the market. Finite element analysis is commonly used to build models for electronic packaging products. However, simulation errors may arise due to differences in physical concepts and considerations among researchers. To overcome this challenge, we create a database through validated finite element models and combine it with machine learning. In the domain of machine learning models, training time is a crucial research focus. Nevertheless, grid search time is often overlooked, despite its significant impact on machine learning model efficiency. To address this issue, this study utilizes parallel computing to explore the search for optimized hyperparameters in the context of the Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP) as a case study. Additionally, custom empirical formulas are utilized to enhance the efficiency of grid search methods, thereby improving the time-to-market and competitiveness of packaged products.

AB The design of power packages with both high efficiency and high-power density performance while maintaining the highest possible reliability is a challenge. During development for power package, design of experiment (DOE) by simulation can effectively shorten the design cycle, reduce costs, and effectively optimize the packaging structure. However, the simulation analysis results are highly dependent on the individual researcher and are only part of overview of factor. Especially, as the package size continuously decrease for high-density designs, there are lots of challenge areas, like thin die pick-up process, material optimization to enhance process and reliability performance. Machine learning (ML) within the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) simulation can be very effective tools to help address these challenges.
   In this paper, application of ML algorithms and enabled simulation for die pick-up process and reliability testing related to power device are discussed. For thin die pick-up process, Bayesian optimization was used to optimize the parameters to achieve the lowest die stress under a given condition. An automatic molding compound selection framework is proposed to generate the optimal material properties of epoxy molding compound (EMC) properties for solder joint reliability. Through these cases, it has been demonstrated that the AI-enabled simulation can be utilized to significantly improve parameter optimization and material selection for robust power device development.

AB In order to ensure uninterrupted operation over time-inservice, progressive assessment of damage accrual and remaining useful life is needed to allow for early identification of impending failure. This paper proposes Prognostics Health Management methods for feature vector-based assessment of damage initiation and progression in electronic systems. The methods can be used to detect impending failures in mission-critical electronics while they are in operation or to assess mission readiness before deployment. Previous research in the field has focused on using fuses and canaries to detect impending failure. Prior implementation of data-driven methods frequently disregards failure mechanics. A method for assessing evolving damage in complex systems with nonlinear material behavior has been presented. For various mechanical shock and vibration levels, feature vectors have been identified for predicting remaining useful life. Damage progression was investigated in test vehicles made from various solder interconnects, including SAC105 and SAC305, with the same assembly geometry and architecture. The changes in feature vectors caused by differences in solder material were also investigated. In order to create meaningful data vectors for correlation with the underlying damage progression in pristine and aged assemblies, feature-vector engineering has been pursued. The feature vector selected from the strain signal's time and frequency domain analysis is modeled using the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) deep learning technique to predict the packages' remaining useful files during the drop. Validation cases for the feature vectors identified in the study have been presented by correlating the plastic work predicted by finite element simulation with that predicted by LSTM. Furthermore, the prediction of remaining useful life has been correlated with experimentally measured time to failure.

AB This study proposes an artificial intelligence-based model that utilizes irradiance data acquired with the Digital Twin of a modern flash Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor to predict the relative position and orientation of a 4-receiver lens stack model in the receiver path of a flash LiDAR system. Therefore, the artificial intelligence is able to analyze potential errors in the alignment of the lens stack.
   The data used to train and validate the described convolutional neural network is a result of optical simulations generated with Zemax Opticstudio, utilizing a Monte Carlo approach.
   The success of the proposed method is effectively proven by showing superior error estimation results.

AB Machine learning algorithms are powerful AI tools that have demonstrated strong robustness and reliability in the performance prediction of road infrastructure. In this study, the authors have attempted to develop a prediction model to estimate the transverse cracking in jointed plain cement concrete pavements using three machine learning approaches, namely, decision tree regression (DTR), random forest regression (RFR), and deep neural network (DNN). The results show that the DNN model outperformed DTR and RFR with coefficients of determination (R-2) greater than 0.95 in both training and testing data sets. Performance metrics are summarised and presented for all three methods used in this study.

AB The early detection of digestive problems is essential for lowering the chance of acquiring any form of gastrointestinal cancer, including esophageal cancer. Endoscopy is the method that is used the majority of the time for the purpose of examining and taking photos of this sort of illness. The application of artificial intelligence is now proving to be very efficient in enhancing the identification of gastrointestinal polyps and other abnormal features located inside the gastrointestinal system. As a direct consequence of this development, the use of AI within this sector has seen substantial growth. In the framework of artificial intelligence, this research investigates how well various types of algorithms perform in terms of polyp and abnormal feature recognition accuracy, efficiency, and detection. And introduced a model in this work that is GastroNet. It is developed by doing hyperparameter fine-tuning on YOLOv5 in order to find specific polyps and abnormal characteristics, particularly esophagitis. In this method, a single neural network is used to do an analysis on the whole picture before it is disassembled into its component parts and the bounding boxes and probabilities for each one are calculated independently. The goal of the hyperparameter fine-tuning is to further enhance the overall optimization of the model. Two different methods of annotation were used on a collection of data that consisted of one thousand separate images that needed to be labelled. In addition to implementing the fine-tuned SSD model, this study used three distinct backbone networks: MobileNet v2, MobileNet v2 FPN Lite, and Resnet50 v1 FPN. Additionally, this study has used CSPdarknet53 to create the improved YOLOv4 model. The results of the studies demonstrate that the proposed model, GastroNet was effective in correctly recognizing polyps and aberrant characteristics, reaching a high mAP (mean Average Precision), F1 score, and precision with a value of 0.99 and recall with a value of 1.00. The findings of this research will be a great help to physicians in the proper identification and diagnosis of abnormal features and gastrointestinal polyps.

AB Jeju Island faces curtailment problems when renewable energy generation exceeds the facility capacity. In addition, the renewable energy system cannot achieve consistent operation because of the uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and their complex spatiotemporal patterns. Climate change and extreme meteorological phenomena also affect the energy system of the island. Therefore, it is essential to maximize RES exploitation to accomplish carbon-free energy production. This study developed a rolling horizon optimization-based flexible renewable energy distribution planning (FxRE-Plan) based on an artificial intelligence driven spatiotemporal RES prediction model. An adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network (AGCRN) was used to develop a spatiotemporal prediction model. Then, FxRE-Plan was determined using a multiobjective genetic algorithm to maximize the RES potential under climate change scenarios. The FxRE-Plan was evaluated and compared with the current operation of the electric grid in Jeju Island through economic, environmental cost, and climate change vulnerability assessment index. The results of this research show that the AGCRN-based spatiotemporal prediction model exhibited superior prediction performance, achieving a 95% R2. In addition, the FxRE-Plan reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 11.5% at maximum and climate change vulnerability. Hence, the proposed FxRE-Plan can be used to solve curtailments in real electric grids by pursuing carbon-free islands.

AB Objective. Ultrasound is extensively utilized as a convenient and cost-effective method in emergency situations. Unfortunately, the limited availability of skilled clinicians in emergency hinders the wider adoption of point-of-care ultrasound. To overcome this challenge, this paper aims to aid less experienced healthcare providers in emergency lung ultrasound scans. Approach. To assist healthcare providers, it is important to have a comprehensive model that can automatically guide the entire process of lung ultrasound based on the clinician's workflow. In this paper, we propose a framework for diagnosing pneumothorax using artificial intelligence (AI) assistance. Specifically, the proposed framework for lung ultrasound scan follows the steps taken by skilled physicians. It begins with finding the appropriate transducer position on the chest to locate the pleural line accurately in B-mode. The next step involves acquiring temporal M-mode data to determine the presence of lung sliding, a crucial indicator for pneumothorax. To mimic the sequential process of clinicians, two DL models were developed. The first model focuses on quality assurance (QA) and regression of the pleural line region-of-interest, while the second model classifies lung sliding. To achieve the inference on a mobile device, a size of EfficientNet-Lite0 model was further reduced to have fewer than 3 million parameters. Main results. The results showed that both the QA and lung sliding classification models achieved over 95% in area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), while the ROI performance reached 89% in the dice similarity coefficient. The entire stepwise pipeline was simulated using retrospective data, yielding an AUC of 89%. Significance. The step-wise AI framework for the pneumothorax diagnosis with QA offers an intelligible guide for each clinical workflow, which achieved significantly high precision and real-time inferences.

AB Purpose: To validate a novel deep learning-based metal artifact correction (MAC) algorithm for CT, namely, AI-MAC, in preclinical setting with comparison to conventional MAC and virtual monochromatic imaging (VMI) technique.Materials and methods: An experimental phantom was designed by consecutively inserting two sets of pedicle screws (size phi 6.5 x 30-mm and phi 7.5 x 40-mm) into a vertebral specimen to simulate the clinical scenario of metal implantation. The resulting MAC, VMI, and AI-MAC images were compared with respect to the metal-free reference image by subjective scoring, as well as by CT attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and correction accuracy via adaptive segmentation of the paraspinal muscle and vertebral body.Results: The AI-MAC and VMI images showed significantly higher subjective scores than the MAC image (all p < 0.05). The SNRs and CNRs on the AI-MAC image were comparable to the reference (all p > 0.05), whereas those on the VMI were significantly lower (all p < 0.05). The paraspinal muscle segmented on the AI-MAC image was 4.6% and 5.1% more complete to the VMI and MAC images for the phi 6.5 x 30-mm screws, and 5.0% and 5.1% for the phi 7.5 x 40-mm screws, respectively. The vertebral body segmented on the VMI was closest to the reference, with only 3.2% and 7.4% overestimation for phi 6.5 x 30-mm and phi 7.5 x 40-mm screws, respectively.Conclusions: Using metal-free reference as the ground truth for comparison, the AI-MAC outperforms VMI in characterizing soft tissue, while VMI is useful in skeletal depiction.

DE Additive manufacturing; Porosity detection; Artificial intelligence;
   Supervised classification
AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is an attractive solution for many companies that produce geometrically complex parts. This process consists of depositing material layer by layer following a sliced CAD geometry. It brings several benefits to manufacturing capabilities, such as design freedom, reduced material waste, and short-run customization. However, one of the current challenges faced by users of the process, mainly in wire laser metal deposition (wLMD), is to avoid defects in the manufactured part, especially the porosity. This defect is caused by extreme con-ditions and metallurgical transformations of the process. And not only does it directly affect the mechanical performance of the parts, especially the fatigue properties, but it also means an in-crease in costs due to the inspection tasks to which the manufactured parts must be subjected. This work compares three operational solution approaches, product-centric, based on signal-based feature extraction and Topological Data Analysis together with statistical and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, for the early detection and prediction of porosity failure in a wLMD process. The different forecasting and validation strategies demonstrate the variety of conclusions that can be drawn with different objectives in the analysis of the monitored data in AM problems.

   Law; Switzerland; Vertical Epistemic Communities
AB Subnational entities in federal states typically retain a degree of sovereignty and enjoy leeway in implementation, raising questions such as whether-and how-international law is actually implemented at the subnational level. This article sheds light on these questions, using two contrasted case studies in Switzerland: The Istanbul Convention on domestic violence and the European Union (EU) Directive 2016/680 on data protection. Based on a document analysis of the law-making process and 44 semi-structured interviews with national and subnational political actors, we observe how international obligations are legally implemented, that is, transposed into legislation at the subnational level. Our results show that: (1) Subnational civil servants play a decisive role, while members of parliament are marginal. (2) Civil servants may constitute Vertical Epistemic Communities (VECs), which are able to "technicize" the issue to ensure swift implementation through administrative venues. (3) VECs are particularly influential as they use intercantonal conferences as institutional platforms to shape implementation processes. Otherwise, implementation becomes politicized, and its success strongly depends on subnational politics.
   Les entites infranationales des etats federaux conservent generalement un certain degre de souverainete et jouissent d'une marge de man & OELIG;uvre dans la mise en & OELIG;uvre, ce qui souleve des questions, telles que si - et comment - le droit international est reellement mis en & OELIG;uvre au niveau infranational. Cet article apporte un eclairage sur ces questions, en s'appuyant sur deux etudes de cas contrastees en Suisse: La Convention d'Istanbul sur la violence domestique et la Directive 2016/680 de l'Union europeenne (UE) sur la protection des donnees. Sur la base d'une analyse documentaire des processus legislatifs et de 44 entretiens semi-structures avec des acteurs politiques nationaux et infranationaux, nous observons comment les obligations internationales sont legalement mises en & OELIG;uvre, c'est-a-dire transposees dans la legislation au niveau infranational. Nos resultats montrent que: (1) Les fonctionnaires infranationaux jouent un role decisif, tandis que les membres des parlements sont marginaux. (2) Les fonctionnaires peuvent constituer des Vertical Epistemic Communities (VECs), capables de & DLANGBRAC; techniciser & drangbrac; une thematique afin d'assurer une mise en & OELIG;uvre rapide par le biais des instances administratives. (3) Les VECs sont particulierement influentes car elles utilisent les conferences intercantonales comme plateformes institutionnelles pour orienter les processus de mise en & OELIG;uvre. Dans le cas contraire, la mise en & OELIG;uvre devient politisee et son succes depend fortement de facteurs politiques infranationaux.
   Subnationale Einheiten in foderalen Staaten behalten in der Regel ein gewisses Mass an Souveranitat und verfugen uber einen mehr oder weniger grossen Umsetzungsspielraum, was z.B. die Frage aufwirft, ob bzw. wie internationales Recht auf subnationaler Ebene tatsachlich umgesetzt wird. Dieser Artikel beleuchtet diese Fragen anhand von zwei kontrastierenden Fallstudien in der Schweiz: Die Istanbul-Konvention gegen hauslicher Gewalt und die Richtlinie 2016/680 der Europaischen Union (EU) zum Datenschutz. Auf der Grundlage einer Dokumentenanalyse der Gesetzgebungsprozesse und 44 halbstrukturierten Interviews mit nationalen und subnationalen politischen Akteuren beobachten wir, wie internationale Verpflichtungen rechtlich umgesetzt werden, d.h. wie sie auf subnationaler Ebene in Gesetze & DLANGBRAC;ubersetzt & drangbrac; werden. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen folgendes: (1) Subnationale Beamte spielen eine entscheidende Rolle, Parlamentarier hingegen eine marginale Rolle bei der Umsetzung. (2) Beamte konnen Vertical Epistemic Communities (VECs) bilden, die in der Lage sind, ein Thema zu & DLANGBRAC;technisieren & drangbrac;, um eine rasche Umsetzung durch Verwaltungseinrichtungen zu gewahrleisten. (3) VECs sind besonders einflussreich, da sie interkantonale Konferenzen als institutionelle Plattformen nutzen, um Umsetzungsprozesse zu gestalten. In anderen Fallen wird die Umsetzung politisiert, und der Erfolg des Umsetzungsprozesses hangt stark von der subnationalen Politik ab.
   Le entita subnazionali negli stati federali mantengono tipicamente una certa sovranita e godono di un margine di manovra nell'implementazione. Questa situazione conduce a chiedersi se - e come - il diritto internazionale sia effettivamente attuato a livello subnazionale. Il nostro articolo fa luce su questi interrogativi, utilizzando due casi di studio contrastanti in Svizzera: La Convenzione di Istanbul sulla violenza domestica e la Direttiva dell'Unione Europea (UE) 2016/680 sulla protezione dei dati. Sulla base di un'analisi documentale del processo legislativo e di 44 interviste semi-strutturate con attori politici nazionali e subnazionali, osserviamo come gli obblighi internazionali vengono implementati legalmente, ossia recepiti nella legislazione a livello subnazionale. I risultati mostrano che: (1) I funzionari pubblici subnazionali svolgono un ruolo decisivo, mentre i parlamentari sono marginali. (2) I funzionari pubblici possono costituire Vertical Epistemic Communities (VECs), che sono in grado di "tecnicizzare" la questione per garantire una rapida attuazione attraverso le vie amministrative. (3) Le VEC sono particolarmente influenti perche utilizzano le conferenze intercantonali come piattaforme istituzionali per dare forma ai processi di attuazione. Altrimenti, l'implementazione diventa politicizzata e il suo successo dipende fortemente dalla politica subnazionale.

AB Bots in online social networks can be used for good or bad but their presence is unavoidable and will increase in the future. To investigate how the interaction networks of bots and humans evolve, we created six social bots on Twitter with AI language models and let them carry out standard user operations. Three different strategies were implemented for the bots: a trend-targeting strategy (TTS), a keywords-targeting strategy (KTS) and a user-targeting strategy (UTS). We examined the interaction patterns such as targeting users, spreading messages, propagating relationships, and engagement. We focused on the emergent local structures or motifs and found that the strategies of the social bots had a significant impact on them. Motifs resulting from interactions with bots following TTS or KTS are simple and show significant overlap, while those resulting from interactions with UTS-governed bots lead to more complex motifs. These findings provide insights into human-bot interaction patterns in online social networks, and can be used to develop more effective bots for beneficial tasks and to combat malicious actors.

AB It is widely accepted that biased data leads to biased and thus potentially unfair models. Therefore, several measures for bias in data and model predictions have been proposed, as well as bias mitigation techniques whose aim is to learn models that are fair by design. Despite the myriad of mitigation techniques developed in the past decade, however, it is still poorly understood under what circumstances which methods work. Recently, Wick et al. showed, with experiments on synthetic data, that there exist situations in which bias mitigation techniques lead to more accurate models when measured on unbiased data. Nevertheless, in the absence of a thorough mathematical analysis, it remains unclear which techniques are effective under what circumstances. We propose to address this problem by establishing relationships between the type of bias and the effectiveness of a mitigation technique, where we categorize the mitigation techniques by the bias measure they optimize. In this paper we illustrate this principle for label and selection bias on the one hand, and demographic parity and "We're All Equal" on the other hand. Our theoretical analysis allows to explain the results of Wick et al. and we also show that there are situations where minimizing fairness measures does not result in the fairest possible distribution.

AB Mulberry leaves feed Bombyx mori silkworms to generate silk thread. Diseases that affect mulberry leaves have reduced crop and silk yields in sericulture, which produces 90% of the world's raw silk. Manual leaf disease identification is tedious and error-prone. Computer vision can categorize leaf diseases early and overcome the challenges of manual identification. No mulberry leaf deep learning (DL) models have been reported. Therefore, in this study, two types of leaf diseases: leaf rust and leaf spot, with disease-free leaves, were collected from two regions of Bangladesh. Sericulture experts annotated the leaf images. The images were pre-processed, and 6,000 synthetic images were generated using typical image augmentation methods from the original 764 training images. Additional 218 and 109 images were employed for testing and validation respectively. In addition, a unique lightweight parallel depth-wise separable CNN model, PDS-CNN was developed by applying depth-wise separable convolutional layers to reduce parameters, layers, and size while boosting classification performance. Finally, the explainable capability of PDS-CNN is obtained through the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) evaluated by a sericulture specialist. The proposed PDS-CNN outperforms well-known deep transfer learning models, achieving an optimistic accuracy of 95.05 & PLUSMN; 2.86% for three-class classifications and 96.06 & PLUSMN; 3.01% for binary classifications with only 0.53 million parameters, 8 layers, and a size of 6.3 megabytes. Furthermore, when compared with other well-known transfer models, the proposed model identified mulberry leaf diseases with higher accuracy, fewer factors, fewer layers, and lower overall size. The visually expressive SHAP explanation images validate the models' findings aligning with the predictions made the sericulture specialist. Based on these findings, it is possible to conclude that the explainable AI (XAI)-based PDS-CNN can provide sericulture specialists with an effective tool for accurately categorizing mulberry leaves.

AB Total hip revision with osseous defects can be very difficult. Artificial intelligence offers preoperative planning, real-time measurement, and intraoperative judgment, which can guide prothesis placement more accurately. Three-dimensional printed metel augment modules which are made according to the individualized osseous anatomy, can fit the osseous defects well and provide mechanical support. In this case, we used AI to plan the size and position of the acetabular cup and 3D-printed augmented modules in a complicated hip revision with an acetabular bone defects, which achieved stable fixation and relieved hip pain postoperatively.

TI AI in Surgical Curriculum Design and Unintended Outcomes for Technical
   Competencies in Simulation Training
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION
AB IMPORTANCE To better elucidate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in surgical skills training requires investigations in the potential existence of a hidden curriculum.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the pedagogical value of AI-selected technical competencies and their extended effects in surgical simulation training.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was a follow-up of a randomized clinical trial conducted at the Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre at the Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Canada. Surgical performance metrics of medical students exposed to an AI-enhanced training curriculum were compared with a control group of participants who received no feedback and with expert benchmarks. Cross-sectional data were collected from January to April 2021 from medical students and from March 2015 to May 2016 from experts. This follow-up secondary analysis was conducted from June to September 2022. Participants included medical students (undergraduate year 0-2) in the intervention cohorts and neurosurgeons to establish expertise benchmarks.
   EXPOSURE Performance assessment and personalized feedback by an intelligent tutor on 4 AI-selected learning objectives during simulation training.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes of interest were unintended performance outcomes, measured by significant within-participant difference from baseline in 270 performance metrics in the intervention cohort that was not observed in the control cohort.
   RESULTS A total of 46 medical students (median [range] age, 22 [18-27] years; 27 [59%] women) and 14 surgeons (median [range] age, 45 [35-59] years; 14 [100%] men) were included in this study, and no participant was lost to follow-up. Feedback on 4 AI-selected technical competencies was associated with additional performance change in 32 metrics over the entire procedure and 20 metrics during tumor removal that was not observed in the control group. Participants exposed to the AI-enhanced curriculum demonstrated significant improvement in safety metrics, such as reducing the rate of healthy tissue removal (mean difference, -7.05 x 10(-5) [95% CI, -1.09 x 10(-4) to -3.14 x 10(-5)] mm(3) per 20 ms; P <.001) and maintaining a focused bimanual control of the operative field (mean difference in maximum instrument divergence, -4.99 [95% CI, -8.48 to -1.49] mm, P =.006) compared with the control group. However, negative unintended effects were also observed. These included a significantly lower velocity and acceleration in the dominant hand (velocity: mean difference, -0.13 [95% CI, -0.17 to -0.09] mmper 20 ms; P <.001; acceleration: mean difference, -2.25 x 10(-2) [95% CI, -3.20 x 10(-2) to -1.31 x 10(-2)] mmper 20 ms(2); P <.001) and a significant reduction in the rate of tumor removal (mean difference, -4.85 x 10(-5) [95% CI, -7.22 x 10(-5) to -2.48 x 10(-5)] mm3 per 20 ms; P <.001) compared with control. These unintended outcomes diverged students'movement and efficiency performance metrics away from the expertise benchmarks.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study of medical students, an AI-enhanced curriculum for bimanual surgical skills resulted in unintended changes that improved performance in safety but negatively affected some efficiencymetrics. Incorporating AI in course design requires ongoing assessment to maintain transparency and foster evidence-based learning objectives.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this research study was to understand the simultaneous competitive and social gains of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) usage in organizations. There was a knowledge hiatus regarding the contribution of the deployment of ML and AI technologies and their effects on organizations and society.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study was grounded on the dynamic capabilities (DC) and ML and AI automation-augmentation paradox literature. This research study examined these theoretical perspectives using the response of 239 Indian organizational chief technology officers (CTOs). Partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) path modeling was applied for data analysis.
   Findings - The results indicated that ML and AI technologies organizational usage positively influenced DC initiatives. The findings depicted that DC fully mediated ML and AI-based technologies' effects on firm performance and social performance.
   Research limitations/implications - This study contributed to theoretical discourse regarding the tension between organizational and social outcomes of ML and AI technologies. The study extended the role of DC as a vital strategy in achieving social benefits from ML and AI use. Furthermore, the theoretical tension of the automation-augmentation paradox was explored.
   Practical implications - Organizations deploying ML and AI technologies could apply this study's insights to comprehend the organizational routines to pursue simultaneous competitive benefits and social gains. Furthermore, chief technology executives of organizations could devise how ML and AI technologies usage from a DC perspective could help settle the tension of the automation-augmentation paradox.
   Social implications - Increased ML and AI technologies usage in organizations enhanced DC. They could lead to positive social benefits such as new job creation, increased compensation to skilled employees and greater gender participation in employment. These insights could be derived based on this research study.
   Originality/value - This study was among the first few empirical investigations to provide theoretical and practical insights regarding the organizational and societal benefits of ML and AI usage in organizations because of their DC. This study was also one of the first empirical investigations that addressed the automation-augmentation paradox at the enterprise level.

AB Background: This study assessed the diagnostic performance of a deep learning (DL)-based model for differentiating malignant subcentimeter (<= 10 mm) solid pulmonary nodules (SSPNs) from benign ones in computed tomography (CT) images compared against radiologists with 10 and 15 years of experience in thoracic imaging (medium-senior seniority).Methods: Overall, 200 SSPNs (100 benign and 100 malignant) were retrospectively collected. Malignancy was confirmed by pathology, and benignity was confirmed by follow-up or pathology. CT images were fed into the DL model to obtain the probability of malignancy (range, 0-100%) for each nodule. According to the diagnostic results, enrolled nodules were classified into benign, malignant, or indeterminate. The accuracy and diagnostic composition of the model were compared with those of the radiologists using the McNemar-Bowker test. Enrolled nodules were divided into 3-6-, 6-8-, and 8-10-mm subgroups. For each subgroup, the diagnostic results of the model were compared with those of the radiologists.Results: The accuracy of the DL model, in differentiating malignant and benign SSPNs, was significantly higher than that of the radiologists (71.5% vs. 38.5%, P<0.001). The DL model reported more benign or malignant deterministic results and fewer indeterminate results. In subgroup analysis of nodule size, the DL model also yielded higher performance in comparison with that of the radiologists, providing fewer indeterminate results. The accuracy of the two methods in the 3-6-, 6-8-, and 8-10-mm subgroups was 75.5% vs. 28.3% (P<0.001), 62.0% vs. 28.2% (P<0.001), and 77.6% vs. 55.3% (P=0.001), respectively, and the indeterminate results were 3.8% vs. 66.0%, 8.5% vs. 66.2%, and 2.6% vs. 35.5% (all P<0.001), respectively.Conclusions: The DL-based method yielded higher performance in comparison with that of the radiologists in differentiating malignant and benign SSPNs. This DL model may reduce uncertainty in diagnosis and improve diagnostic accuracy, especially for SSPNs smaller than 8 mm.

AB Importance The benefit of endovascular stroke therapy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke is highly time dependent. Process improvements to accelerate in-hospital workflows are critical.Objective To determine whether automated computed tomography (CT) angiogram interpretation coupled with secure group messaging can improve in-hospital EVT workflows.Design, Setting, and Participants This cluster randomized stepped-wedge clinical trial took place from January 1, 2021, through February 27, 2022, at 4 comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs) in the greater Houston, Texas, area. All 443 participants with LVO stroke who presented through the emergency department were treated with EVT at the 4 CSCs. Exclusion criteria included patients presenting as transfers from an outside hospital (n = 158), in-hospital stroke (n = 39), and patients treated with EVT through randomization in a large core clinical trial (n = 3).Intervention Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled automated LVO detection from CT angiogram coupled with secure messaging was activated at the 4 CSCs in a random-stepped fashion. Once activated, clinicians and radiologists received real-time alerts to their mobile phones notifying them of possible LVO within minutes of CT imaging completion.Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was the effect of AI-enabled LVO detection on door-to-groin (DTG) time and was measured using a mixed-effects linear regression model, which included a random effect for cluster (CSC) and a fixed effect for exposure status (pre-AI vs post-AI). Secondary outcomes included time from hospital arrival to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) bolus in eligible patients, time from initiation of CT scan to start of EVT, and hospital length of stay. In exploratory analysis, the study team evaluated the impact of AI implementation on 90-day modified Rankin Scale disability outcomes.Results Among 243 patients who met inclusion criteria, 140 were treated during the unexposed period and 103 during the exposed period. Median age for the complete cohort was 70 (IQR, 58-79) years and 122 were female (50%). Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation was 17 (IQR, 11-22) and the median DTG preexposure was 100 (IQR, 81-116) minutes. In mixed-effects linear regression, implementation of the AI algorithm was associated with a reduction in DTG time by 11.2 minutes (95% CI, -18.22 to -4.2). Time from CT scan initiation to EVT start fell by 9.8 minutes (95% CI, -16.9 to -2.6). There were no differences in IV tPA treatment times nor hospital length of stay. In multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke scale score, and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, there was no difference in likelihood of functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2; odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.42-4.0).Conclusions and Relevance Automated LVO detection coupled with secure mobile phone application-based communication improved in-hospital acute ischemic stroke workflows. Software implementation was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in EVT treatment times.

AB Introduction: Accurate diagnosis and timely management are vital for favorable uveitis outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise in medical decision-making, particularly in ophthalmology. Yet, the diagnostic precision and management advice from AI-based uveitis chatbots lack assessment.
   Methods: We appraised diagnostic accuracy and management suggestions of an AI-based chatbot, ChatGPT, versus five uveitis-trained ophthalmologists, using 25 standard cases aligned with new Uveitis Nomenclature guidelines. Participants predicted likely diagnoses, two differentials, and next management steps. Comparative success rates were computed.
   Results: Ophthalmologists excelled (60-92%) in likely diagnosis, exceeding AI (60%). Considering fully and partially accurate diagnoses, ophthalmologists achieved 76-100% success; AI attained 72%. Despite an 8% AI improvement, its overall performance lagged. Ophthalmologists and AI agreed on diagnosis in 48% cases, with 91.6% exhibiting concurrence in management plans.

AB In this paper, we generalize the identity function and the square root function used in the algebraic equivalent transformation (AET) technique to a class of AET functions with an arbitrary positive integer parameter p. Based on this class of AET functions, we propose a class of wide neighborhood primal-dual interior-point algorithms for linear programming. For each function in this class of AET functions, we define its search direction and its wide neighborhood under a unified framework. The search directions of the proposed algorithms are constructed based on Ai-Zhang type direction and the corresponding second-order corrector direction. Moreover, we provided a unified analysis of the best iteration complexity of the proposed algorithms. Numerical results show the reliability of the proposed algorithms.

AB BackgroundIntradialytic hypotension remains one of the most recurrent complications of dialysis sessions. Inadequate management can lead to adverse outcomes, highlighting the need to develop personalized approaches for the prevention of intradialytic hypotension. Here, we sought to develop and validate two AI-based risk models predicting the occurrence of symptomatic intradialytic hypotension at different time points.MethodsThe models were built using the XGBoost algorithm and they predict the occurrence of intradialytic hypotension in the next dialysis session and in the next month. The initial dataset, obtained from routinely collected data in the EuCliD & REG; Database, was split to perform model derivation, training and validation. Model performance was evaluated by concordance statistic and calibration charts; the importance of features was assessed with the Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) methodology.ResultsThe final dataset included 1,249,813 dialysis sessions, and the incidence rate of intradialytic hypotension was 10.07% (95% CI 10.02-10.13). Our models retained good discrimination (AUC around 0.8) and a suitable calibration yielding to the selection of three classification thresholds identifying four distinct risk groups. Variables providing the most significant impact on risk estimates were blood pressure dynamics and other metrics mirroring hemodynamic instability over time.ConclusionsRecurrent symptomatic intradialytic hypotension could be reliably and accurately predicted using routinely collected data during dialysis treatment and standard clinical care. Clinical application of these prediction models would allow for personalized risk-based interventions for preventing and managing intradialytic hypotension.

AB Cardiac imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure. Given the role that imaging plays in ejection fraction quantification, determination of heart failure etiology, and evaluation of valvular dysfunction, it is crucial that these studies be accurate, reliable, and reproducible. A growing body of research has identified areas where AI can be applied to cardiac imaging. It is likely that future clinical practice will integrate AI in multiple areas, including workflow optimization of imaging laboratories as well as consideration of clinical and imaging parameters to help guide the management of complex heart failure patients.

AB The substantial body of literature focused on imaging examination of renal masses and RCC continues to increase. The Bosniak classification version 2019 and the ccLS are newer algorithms that improve and standardize cystic and solid mass char-acterization, respectively, but diagnostic uncertainty remains in certain instances, including Bosniak III lesions and ccLS score 3 lesions. When combined with the exist-ing modalities, novel imaging techniques including CEUS, dual energy CT, molecular imaging and radiomics have the potential to truly optimize "virtual biopsy," RCC diag-nosis and management. Increasing evidence will ultimately determine which modality or combinations of modalities will provide better renal mass characterization than the current standard. Molecular agents are well positioned to enhance renal mass characterization in the near term, with some agents already FDA-approved for alternative indications. A new agent, 89Zr-DFO-girentuximab, also showed high sensitivity and specificity for clear cell RCC in a recent phase III trial. It is likely molecular and anatomic imaging strategies will be combined into new renal mass characterization algorithms. In the more distant future, radiomics and AI are promising technologies, which may make "virtual biopsy" a reality.

AB Recent increases in the usage of applications dependent on distributed computing have persuaded designers and entrepreneurs to utilize these solutions for diverse purposes, especially latency-constrained computation-intensive applications. Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is the innovative paradigm of distributed computing techniques, and therefore, a number of VFC offloading frameworks have been developed using AI-based advanced optimization procedures, with support from standards maintenance organizations like IEEE, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and some others. However, many of these strategies have not been adapted to specific application data and types, therefore these frameworks may function poorly despite their comprehensive offloading principles. Moreover, most computation offloading frameworks ignore the use of updated V2X protocols. We designed a temporal segmentation and modules (TSM)-based method specific for computation-intensive V2X applications that uses a four-tier hierarchy of resource-rich nodes and works in discrete time periods. TSM relies on status updates from previous time periods and uses predictive analytics to address the stochastic nature of vehicular networks using the latest 3GPP 5G V2X standards. Using an online modular computation offloading structure that heuristically manages the whole process, we were able to successfully and timely execute the latency-sensitive advanced vehicular applications. TSM supports computation-deficient devices in under a hundred milliseconds, makes use of smart vehicles' processing units as fog nodes, and solves the optimization problem in short, discrete stages. We utilized Monte Carlo analysis, which confirmed that TSM outperformed the three other baseline methods.

AB How can we examine so-called 'artificial intelligence' ('AI') without turning our backs on the STS tradition that questions both notions of artificiality and intelligence? This special issue attempts a step to the side: Instead of considering 'AI' as something that does or does not exist (and then taking a position on its benefits or harms), its ambition is to document, in an empirical and agnostic way, the performances that make, sometimes, 'AI' appear or disappear in situation. And it comes out, from this perspective, that 'AI' could be considered a vast commensuration undertaking.

AB Mosquitoes pose a significant risk to millions of people worldwide since they can transmit pathogens. Current methods to control mosquito populations include the use of synthetic pesticides. Nanotechnology may be a solution to develop new mosquito control. However, one barrier to expanding the impact of nanomaterials is the ability to mass-produce the particles. Here, we report a novel hybrid particle synthesis combining micro- and nanoparticles using the coprecipitation technique with the potential for mass production. These particles may have applications as a mosquito larvacide. The particles reported here were designed using a microparticle zein polymer as the core and a nanoparticle silver as the active ingredient. The hybrid NPs reported here targeted a late-stage mosquito larvae and that resulted in a high larval mortality concentration (1.0 ppm, LC90) and suppression of pupal emergence at 0.1 ppm. This research demonstrates the efficacy of a plant-based core with a metal-based AI coating (AgNPs) against larval mosquitoes.

AB Chemistry education research demonstrates the value of open-ended writing tasks, such as writing-to-learn (WTL) assignments, for supporting students' learning with topics including reasoning about reaction mechanisms. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as chatbots ChatGPT and Bard, raises concerns regarding the value of open-ended writing tasks in the classroom; one concern involves academic integrity and whether students will use these chatbots to produce sufficient responses to open-ended writing tasks. The present study investigates the degree to which generative AI chatbots exhibit mechanistic reasoning in response to organic chemistry WTL assignments. We produced responses from three generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard) to two WTL assignments developed to elicit students' mechanistic reasoning. Using previously reported machine learning models for analyzing student writing in response to the WTL assignments, we analyzed the chatbot responses for the inclusion of features pertinent to mechanistic reasoning. Herein, we report quantitative analyses of (1) the differences between chatbot responses on the two assignments and (2) the differences between chatbot and authentic student responses. Findings indicate that chatbots respond differently to different WTL assignments. Additionally, the chatbots rarely incorporated the discussion of electron movement, a key feature of mechanistic reasoning. Furthermore, the chatbots, in general, do not engage in mechanistic reasoning at the same level as students. We contextualize the results by considering academic integrity with the assumption that students' intentions are to engage in academically honest behavior, and we focus on understanding the ethical uses of generative AI for classroom assignments.

ID RECOGNITION
AB There is growing recognition of the value of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) in libraries. This study explores how academic libraries have responded to this opportunity at the level of strategy, what is the status of the application of AI, if any, and what are the different emphases of development comparing the UK and China. The data for the study was strategy documentation from high-ranking universities and their libraries. The sample consisted of the top 25 universities from the United Kingdom and top 25 from the Mainland of China according to the QS world university rankings. Explicit mention of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies is rarely found in strategic plans of universities in the UK but most Chinese universities mention them in their vision statements which focus on the development of new majors and research of the technology. Though several libraries have already implemented applications based on AI or claim to be "smart" or "intelligent" most academic library strategic plans or agendas do not emphasize AI. This is one of the first studies to explore the current status of AI applied in academic libraries as a sector and to compare experiences internationally.

AB The extent of knowledge available to society may no longer be limited by human cognition or by refining algorithms. Instead, the interaction of the two may limit knowledge transfer and creation. We examine two behavioral paradoxes: Polanyi's paradox, which has existed since 1966, and the Trust paradox, which we propose. We study four technology innovations-printing, digitalization, the Internet, and artificial intelligence (AI)-and assess how these paradoxes limit the use of knowledge created by each innovation. We found that while technology has largely overcome Polanyi's paradox of limiting the transfer of tacit knowledge, the Trust paradox may limit the application of AI-generated knowledge. We identify five relevant drivers of trust-reliability, transparency, association, reciprocity, and accountability-and outline how each impacts and creates challenges for the application of AI.

   image classification; information fusion
AB Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, painful, progressive disease usually seen in the spine. Traditional diagnostic methods have limitations in detecting the early stages of AS. The early diagnosis of AS can improve patients' quality of life. This study aims to diagnose AS with a pre-trained hybrid model using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods: In this research, we collected a new MRI dataset comprising three cases. Furthermore, we introduced a novel deep feature engineering model. Within this model, we utilized three renowned pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs): DenseNet201, ResNet50, and ShuffleNet. Through these pretrained CNNs, deep features were generated using the transfer learning approach. For each pretrained network, two feature vectors were generated from an MRI. Three feature selectors were employed during the feature selection phase, amplifying the number of features from 6 to 18 (calculated as 6 x 3). The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier was utilized in the classification phase to determine classification results. During the information phase, the iterative majority voting (IMV) algorithm was applied to secure voted results, and our model selected the output with the highest classification accuracy. In this manner, we have introduced a self-organized deep feature engineering model. Results: We have applied the presented model to the collected dataset. The proposed method yielded 99.80%, 99.60%, 100%, and 99.80% results for accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score for the collected axial images dataset. The collected coronal image dataset yielded 99.45%, 99.20%, 99.70%, and 99.45% results for accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, respectively. As for contrast-enhanced images, accuracy of 95.62%, recall of 80.72%, precision of 94.24%, and an F1-score of 86.96% were attained. Conclusions: Based on the results, the proposed method for classifying AS disease has demonstrated successful outcomes using MRI. The model has been tested on three cases, and its consistently high classification performance across all cases underscores the model's general robustness. Furthermore, the ability to diagnose AS disease using only axial images, without the need for contrast-enhanced MRI, represents a significant advancement in both healthcare and economic terms.

AB We show that deep learning algorithms can be deployed to study bifurcations of particle trajectories. We demonstrate this for two physical systems, the unperturbed Duffing equation and charged particles in magnetic reversal by using the AI Poincare algorithm. We solve the equations of motion by using a fourth-order Runge- Kutta method to generate a dataset for each system. We use a deep neural network to train the data. A noise characterized by a noise scale L is added to data during the training. By using a principal component analysis, we compute the explained variance ratios for these systems which depend on the noise scale. By plotting explained ratios against the noise scale, we show that they change at bifurcations. For different values of the Duffing equation parameters, these changes are of the form of different patterns of growth-decline of the explained ratios. For the magnetic reversal, the changes are of the form of a change in the number of principal components. We comment on the use of this technique for other dynamical systems with bifurcations.

AB If we look at the chronology of transitions between successive stages of industrialization, it is impossible not to notice a significant acceleration. There were 100 years between the industrial revolutions from 2.0 to 3.0, and only half a century passed from the conventional 3.0 to 4.0. Assuming that progress will inevitably continue to accelerate, and given that 2011 is the set date for the start of the fourth industrial revolution, we can expect Industry 5.0 by 2035. In recent years, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications proliferated, which include multiple network elements connected by wired and wireless communication technologies, as well as sensors and actuators placed in strategic locations. The significant pace of development of the industry of advantages in predicting threats to infrastructure will be related to the speed of analyzing the huge amount of data on threats collected not locally, but globally. This article sheds light on the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), to significantly impact IIoT cyber threat prediction in Industry 5.0.

AB 6G targets a broad and ambitious range of networking scenarios with stringent and diverse requirements. Such challenging demands require a multitude of computational and communication resources and means for their efficient and coordinated management in an end-to-end fashion across various domains. Conventional approaches cannot handle the complexity, dynamicity, and end-to-end scope of the problem, and solutions based on artificial intelligence (AI) become necessary. However, current applications of AI to resource management (RM) tasks provide partial ad hoc solutions that largely lack compatibility with notions of native AI enablers, as foreseen in 6G, and either have a narrow focus, without regard for an end-to-end scope, or employ non-scalable representations/learning. This survey article contributes a systematic demonstration that the 6G vision promotes the employment of appropriate distributed machine learning (ML) frameworks that interact through native AI enablers in a composable fashion towards a versatile and effective end-to-end RM framework. We start with an account of 6G challenges that yields three criteria for benchmarking the suitability of candidate ML-powered RM methodologies for 6G, also in connection with an end-to-end scope. We then proceed with a focused survey of appropriate methodologies in light of these criteria. All considered methodologies are classified in accordance with six distinct methodological frameworks, and this approach invites broader insight into the potential and limitations of the more general frameworks, beyond individual methodologies. The landscape is complemented by considering important AI enablers, discussing their functionality and interplay, and exploring their potential for supporting each of the six methodological frameworks. The article culminates with lessons learned, open issues, and directions for future research.

ID HEALTH RECORD; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES; PLATFORM
AB Background: Blockchain technology has revolutionized the healthcare sector, including emergency medicine, by integrating AI, machine learning, and big data, thereby transforming traditional healthcare practices. The increasing utilization and accumulation of personal health data also raises concerns about security and privacy, particularly within emergency medical settings. Method: Our review focused on articles published in databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, and Medline, discussing the revolutionary impact of blockchain technology within the context of the patient journey through the ED. Results: A total of 33 publications met our inclusion criteria. The findings emphasize that blockchain technology primarily finds its applications in data sharing and documentation. The pre-hospital and post-discharge applications stand out as distinctive features compared to other disciplines. Among various platforms, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric emerge as the most frequently utilized options, while Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Authority (PoA) stand out as the most commonly employed consensus algorithms in this emergency care domain. The ED journey map and two scenarios are presented, exemplifying the most distinctive applications of emergency medicine, and illustrating the potential of blockchain. Challenges such as interoperability, scalability, security, access control, and cost could potentially arise in emergency medical contexts, depending on the specific scenarios. Conclusion: Our study examines the ongoing research on blockchain technology, highlighting its current influence and potential future advancements in optimizing emergency medical services. This approach empowers frontline medical professionals to validate their practices and recognize the transformative potential of blockchain in emergency medical care, ultimately benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.

AB This article aims to make a bibliometric literature review using systematic scientific mapping and content analysis of digital twins in healthcare to know the evolution, domain, keywords, content type, and kind and purpose of digital twin's implementation in healthcare, so a consolidation and future improvement of existing knowledge can be made and gaps for new studies can be identified.The increase in publications of digital twins in healthcare is quite recent and it is still concentrated in the domain of technology sources. The subject is majorly concentrated in patient's digital twin group and in precision medicine and aspects, issues and/or policies subgroups, although the publications keywords mirror it only at the group side. Digital twins in healthcare are probably stepping out of the infancy phase. On the other hand, digital twins in hospital group and the device and facilities management subgroups are more mature with all knowledge gathered from the manufacturing sector. There is an absence of some publication's types in general, device and care subgroup and no whole body or hospital digital twin was reported. Based on the presented arguments, guidelines for future research were presented: advance in the creation of general frameworks, in subgroups not as much explored, and in groups and subgroups already explored, but that need more advancement to achieve the main goals of a whole human or hospital digital twin with the main issues resolved.

AB The diagnosis of ewes' pregnancy status at an early stage is an efficient way to enhance the reproductive output of sheep and allow producers to optimize production and management. The techniques of proteomics and metabolomics have been widely used to detect regulatory factors in various physiological processes of animals. The aim of this study is to explore the differential metabolites and proteins in the serum of pregnant and non-pregnant ewes by proteomics and metabolomics. The serum of ewes at 21, 28 and 33 days after artificial insemination (AI) were collected. The pregnancy stratus of the ewes was finally determined through ultrasound examination and then the ewes were grouped as Pregnant (n = 21) or N on-pregnant (n = 9). First, the serum samples from pregnant or non-pregnant ewes at 21 days after AI were selected for metabolomic analysis. It was found that the level of nine metabolites were upregulated and 20 metabolites were downregulated in the pregnant animals (p < 0.05). None of these differential metabolomes are suitable as markers of pregnancy due to their small foldchange. Next, the proteomes of serum from pregnant or non-pregnant ewes were evaluated. At 21 days after AI, the presence of 321 proteins were detected, and we found that the level of three proteins were upregulated and 11 proteins were downregulated in the serum of pregnant ewes (p < 0.05). The levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), afamin (AFM), serpin family A member 6 (SERPINA6) and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes at 21-, 28- and 33-days post-AI were also analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of SAA and AFM were significantly higher in pregnant ewes than in non-pregnant ewes, and could be used as markers for early pregnancy detection. Overall, our results show that SAA and AFM are potential biomarkers to determine the early pregnancy status of ewes.

AB Otolaryngological diagnoses, such as otitis media, are traditionally performed using endoscopy, wherein diagnostic accuracy can be subjective and vary among clinicians. The integration of objective tools, like artificial intelligence (AI), could potentially improve the diagnostic process by minimizing the influence of subjective biases and variability. We systematically reviewed the AI techniques using medical imaging in otolaryngology. Relevant studies related to AI-assisted otitis media diagnosis were extracted from five databases: Google Scholar, PubMed, Medline, Embase, and IEEE Xplore, without date restrictions. Publications that did not relate to AI and otitis media diagnosis or did not utilize medical imaging were excluded. Of the 32identified studies, 26 used tympanic membrane images for classification, achieving an average diagnosis accuracy of 86% (range: 48.7-99.16%). Another three studies employed both segmentation and classification techniques, reporting an average diagnosis accuracy of 90.8% (range: 88.06-93.9%). These findings suggest that AI technologies hold promise for improving otitis media diagnosis, offering benefits for telemedicine and primary care settings due to their high diagnostic accuracy. However, to ensure patient safety and optimal outcomes, further improvements in diagnostic performance are necessary.

AB Waste concrete powder (WCP) is emerging as a potential method of adoption for CO2 sequestration due to its ability to chemically react with carbon dioxide and trap it within its structure. This study explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) to maximize the absorption of CO2 from waste concrete powder generated by recycling plants for building and demolition debris. Initially, a model is developed to assess CO2 uptake according to carbonation time (CT) and water-to-solid ratio (WSR), utilizing the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) modeling approach. Subsequently, the MPA is employed to estimate the optimal values for CT and WSR, thereby maximizing CO2 uptake. A significant improvement in modeling accuracy is evident when the ANOVA method is replaced with ANFIS, leading to a substantial increase of approximately 19% in the coefficient of determination (R-squared) from 0.84, obtained through ANOVA, to an impressive 0.9999 obtained through the implementation of ANFIS; furthermore, the utilization of ANFIS yields a substantial reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) from 1.96, as indicated by ANOVA, to an impressively low value of 0.0102 with ANFIS. The integration of ANFIS and MPA demonstrates impressive results, with a nearly 30% increase in the percentage value of CO2 uptake. The highest CO2 uptake of 3.86% was achieved when the carbonation time was 54.3 h, and the water-to-solid ratio was 0.27. This study highlights the potential of AI and the MPA as effective tools for optimizing CO2 absorption from waste concrete powder, contributing to sustainable waste management practices in the construction industry.

AB In this article, the authors focus on the use of smart CCTV, a combnation of biometric recognition technology and AI algorithms. In fact, the advancements in relevant technologies brought a significant increase in the use of biometric information - fingerprint, retina, iris or facial recognition - across diverse sectors. Both the public and private sectors, with the developments of biometric technology, widely adopt and use an individual's biometric information for different reasons. For instance, smartphone users highly count on biometric technolgies for the purpose of security. Public and private orgazanitions control an access to confidential information-controlling facilities with biometric technology. Biometric infomration is known to be unique and immutable in the course of one's life. Given the uniquness and immutability, it turned out to be as reliable means for the purpose of authentication and verification. However, the use of biometric information comes with cost, posing a privacy issue. Once it is leaked, there is little chance to recover damages resulting from unauthorized uses. The governments across the country fully understand the threat to privacy rights with the use of biometric information and AI. The EU and the United States amended their data protection laws to regulate it. South Korea aligned with them. Yet, the authors point out that Korean dataaprotection law still requires more improvements to minimize a concern over privacy rights arising from the wide use of biometric information. In particular, the authors stress that it is necessary to amend Section specialIntscript of Article 23 of PIPA to reflect the concern by changing the basis for permitting the processing of sensitive information from 'the Statutes' to 'the Acts'.

AB This study developed digital literacy instruments and tested their effectiveness on college students' perceptions of AI technologies. In creating a new digital literacy test tool, we reviewed the concept and scale of digital literacy based on previous studies that identified the characteristics and measurement of AI literacy. We developed 23 preliminary questions for our research instrument and used a quantitative approach to survey 318 undergraduates. After conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that digital literacy in the age of AI had four ability sub-factors: critical understanding, artificial intelligence social impact recognition, artificial intelligence technology utilization, and ethical behavior. Then we tested the sub-factors' predictive powers on the perception of AI's usefulness and ease of use. The regression result shows that the most common powerful predictor of the usefulness and ease of use of AI technology was the ability to use AI technology. This finding implies that for college students, the ability to use various tools based on AI technology is an essential competency in the AI era.

AB With improving computing performance, various digital platforms are being developed to enable easily utilization of high-performance computing environments. EDISON 1.0 is an online simulation platform widely used in computational science and engineering education. As the research paradigm changes, the demand for developing the EDISON 1.0 platform centered on simulation into the EDISON 2.0 platform centered on data and artificial intelligence is growing. Herein, a data framework, a core module for data-centric research on EDISON 2.0 digital platform, is proposed. The proposed data framework provides the following three functions. First, it provides a data repository suitable for the data lifecycle to increase research reproducibility. Second, it provides a new data model that can integrate, manage, search, and utilize heterogeneous data to support a data-driven interdisciplinary convergence research environment. Finally, it provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) service and data enrichment using an AI model, both developed to strengthen data reliability and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of research endeavors. Using the EDISON 2.0 data framework, researchers can conduct interdisciplinary convergence research using heterogeneous data and easily perform data pre-processing through the web-based UI. Further, it presents the opportunity to leverage the derived data obtained through AI technology to gain insights and create new research topics.

AB Algorithms in the age of artificial intelligence (AI) constantly transform customer behaviour, marketing programs, and marketing strategies in industrial markets. However, algorithms often fail to perform as expected due to various data, model, and market biases. Motivated by this challenge, this study presents a framework of algorithmic bias management capabilities for industrial markets that contribute to customer equity in terms of value, brand and relationship equity. Drawing on the dynamic capability theory, this study fills this gap by conducting a literature review, thematic analysis, and two rounds of surveys (n=200 analytics professionals and n=200 business customers) in the financial service industry in Australia. The findings show that algorithmic bias management capability consists of three primary dimensions (data, model, and deployment capabilities) and nine subdimensions. These findings have important implications for scholars and managers interested in developing algorithmic bias management capabilities to influence customer equity in industrial markets.

AB IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) and neuroimaging offer new opportunities for diagnosis and prognosis of dementia. MethodsWe systematically reviewed studies reporting AI for neuroimaging in diagnosis and/or prognosis of cognitive neurodegenerative diseases. ResultsA total of 255 studies were identified. Most studies relied on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Algorithmic classifiers were the most commonly used AI method (48%) and discriminative models performed best for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from controls. The accuracy of algorithms varied with the patient cohort, imaging modalities, and stratifiers used. Few studies performed validation in an independent cohort. DiscussionThe literature has several methodological limitations including lack of sufficient algorithm development descriptions and standard definitions. We make recommendations to improve model validation including addressing key clinical questions, providing sufficient description of AI methods and validating findings in independent datasets. Collaborative approaches between experts in AI and medicine will help achieve the promising potential of AI tools in practice. HighlightsThere has been a rapid expansion in the use of machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis in neurodegenerative diseaseMost studies (71%) relied on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with no other individual dataset used more than five timesThere has been a recent rise in the use of more complex discriminative models (e.g., neural networks) that performed better than other classifiers for classification of AD vs healthy controlsWe make recommendations to address methodological considerations, addressing key clinical questions, and validationWe also make recommendations for the field more broadly to standardize outcome measures, address gaps in the literature, and monitor sources of bias

AB Introduction: Diagnostic and therapeutic methods for colorectal cancer (CRC) have advanced; however, they may be inaccessible worldwide, and their widespread use is challenging. This questionnaire survey investigates the current status of diagnosis and treatment of early-stage CRC in Asian countries. Methods: Responses to the questionnaire were obtained from 213 doctors at different institutions in 8 countries and regions. The questionnaire consisted of 39 questions on the following four topics: noninvasive diagnosis other than endoscopy (6 questions), diagnosis by magnification and image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) including artificial intelligence (AI) (10 questions), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), proper use among other therapeutic methods (11 questions), and pathologic diagnosis and surveillance (12 questions). Results: Although 101 of 213 respondents were affiliated with academic hospitals, there were disparities among countries and regions in the dissemination of advanced technologies, such as IEE, AI, and ESD. The NICE classification is widely used for the diagnosis of colorectal tumors using IEE, while the JNET classification with magnification was used in countries such as Japan (65/70, 92.9%) and China (16/22, 72.7%). Of the 211 respondents, 208 (98.6%) assumed that en bloc resection should be achieved for carcinomas, and 180 of 212 (84.9%) believed that ESD was the most suitable in cases with a diameter larger than 2 cm. However, colorectal ESD is not widespread in countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Conclusion: The promotion of advanced technologies and education should be continual to enable more people to benefit from them.

AB INTRODUCTIONThe use of applied modeling in dementia risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognostics will have substantial public health benefits, particularly as "deep phenotyping" cohorts with multi-omics health data become available. METHODSThis narrative review synthesizes understanding of applied models and digital health technologies, in terms of dementia risk prediction, diagnostic discrimination, prognosis, and progression. Machine learning approaches show evidence of improved predictive power compared to standard clinical risk scores in predicting dementia, and the potential to decompose large numbers of variables into relatively few critical predictors. RESULTSThis review focuses on key areas of emerging promise including: emphasis on easier, more transparent data sharing and cohort access; integration of high-throughput biomarker and electronic health record data into modeling; and progressing beyond the primary prediction of dementia to secondary outcomes, for example, treatment response and physical health. DISCUSSIONSuch approaches will benefit also from improvements in remote data measurement, whether cognitive (e.g., online), or naturalistic (e.g., watch-based accelerometry).

AB Background: Increasing evidence suggests that heroin addiction may be related to the dysfunction among the triple brain network (default mode network [DMN], salience network [SN] and executive control network [ECN]). However, the characteristics of glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity among core regions of the triple brain network remain unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that individuals with heroin dependence would show abnormal glucose metabolism and accompanied abnormal metabolic connectivity within the triple brain network. Methods: Individuals with heroin dependence and healthy controls matched for age and sex underwent integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). Differences in glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity among the DMN, SN and ECN were analyzed based on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and resting-state fMRI data. Results: We included 36 individuals with heroin dependence and 30 matched healthy controls in our study. The heroin dependence group showed a significant reduction of glucose metabolism in the bilateral anterior insula (AI) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and a significantly decreased metabolic connectivity between the right AI and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The daily dose of methadone was negatively correlated with glucose metabolism of the right AI and right IPL. Limitations: The results revealed the glucose metabolism alterations and metabolic connectivity only within the triple brain network in individuals with heroin dependence; additional brain networks should be investigated in future studies. Although methadone is an opioid with a similar neurophysiological mechanism as heroin, the specific chronic effects of methadone on cerebral metabolism and metabolic connectivity should also be investigated in future studies. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that long-term opioid use might, to some extent, be associated with reduced synergistic ability between the SN and ECN, which may be associated with the dysfunction of cognitive control. In particular, the right AI, which showed hypometabolism and related reduction in SN-ECN metabolic connectivity, should receive increasing attention in future studies.

AB While artificial intelligence (AI) as a technology has been gaining widespread media and popular attention, its historical analysis is still in its infancy. As Jon Agar noted, "There is a surprising absence in the secondary literature of survey histories of artificial intelligence written by professional historians of science" [4, p. 291].1 When we began our own project on the history of AI in the Federal Republic of Germany,2 we found that we had to agree: Each project member-there are five of us (Florian Muller, Dinah Pfau, Helen Piel, Rudolf Seising, and Jakob Tschandl)-individually investigates one subject area of AI and has often found little historical work.3 What is more, the available histories, both monographs and articles, strongly focus on US developments (occasionally including British developments, Alan Turing, and Donald Michie) and are often written by practitioners and nonhistorians [12], [14], [16], [25], [34], [42], [63]. This prevalence of practitioner (as well as popular) accounts is being replicated outside the US too [9], [10], [11], [53]. While valuable as sources, these can only be a first step toward a thorough historical analysis of AI that extends beyond its US origins. This Special Issue therefore collects several histories of AI in Europe by historians and media theorists.

AB This article presents an overview of Turing's early contributions to machine intelligence, together with a summary of his influence on other early practitioners. Following his famous work on the Entscheidungsproblem in the 1930s, Turing staked out the field of machine intelligence during the 1940s. His wartime Bombe used what we now call heuristic search to do work requiring intelligence when done by humans. In key papers in 1948 and 1950 he discussed search, learning, robotics, chess, the theorem-proving approach to AI, the genetic algorithm concept, and artificial neural networks, as well as introducing the Turing test. He influenced the first generation of programmers in Britain, whose pioneering contributions to machine intelligence included work on board games, learning, language-processing, and reasoning-contributions made years before the term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at Dartmouth in 1956.

AB The "KI-Rundbrief" (AI newsletter) of the AI specialist group in the German Informatics Society is considered central to the emerging West German AI community. It was mailed out between 1975 and 1987, when it was turned into the journal Kunstliche Intelligenz. Despite its presumed centrality, it has not been studied in detail. This article combines a quantitative analysis of which research was published in the newsletter heuristically with a qualitative analysis looking at the role of the newsletter and its editors. It focuses especially on the subject areas deduction, natural language processing, expert systems, image processing, and cognitive science, showing that the newsletter only partially represents artificial intelligence research in the Federal Republic of Germany.

AB AI research and development in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) can be seen as paradigmatic for the phase of late socialism. The imperatives of the socialist project and its economic ramifications in the endgame of the Cold War left a distinct imprint on AI. The GDR adopted a pragmatic approach to AI, which this article examines. It highlights the various strands and applications of late socialist AI research, encompassing both everyday applications and advanced scientific endeavors. Moving beyond the prevailing focus on U.S. research within the military-industrial complex, this article situates AI research within the broader history of the GDR, Central, and Eastern Europe. This study employs methods from science and technology studies to analyze AI objects, particularly chess computers, as indicators of the proliferation of AI within the everyday practices of the GDR. Through a thorough examination of a widely circulated computer magazine, this overview illustrates the diverse range of AI applications in the GDR, spanning areas such as planning, industrial management, state administration, science, public health, and pervasive surveillance. In this context, high-tech solutions were deployed alongside decaying industrial infrastructure, while utopian visions of intelligent machines intersected with ideological exhaustion, and health care applications were juxtaposed with fleeing doctors. These ambivalences reflect the complex state of the GDR in late socialism. Nevertheless, researchers and engineers worked on prototypes for image recognition, language processing, automatic reasoning and basic AI technologies, including programming languages and specialized hardware.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; IMPACT
AB Hyperautomation is a business-driven approach, conceptualized in 2019 by Gartner Inc., that combines various technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and integrated platforms as a service (iPaas) with the aim of making business processes more efficient by substituting human intervention. Among these, implementations of AI within business services use technologies like Natural Language Processing, Voice and Image Recognition, Virtual Agents, Machine Learning or Deep Learning platforms. Acknowledging this reality, we are interested in developing answers to the following research questions: (1) What are the main categories of business services which integrate specific AI tools? (2) What are the transformed business processes and their operations provided by AI tools? (3) What are the benefits related to AI integrated tools? For this triadic purpose, a systematic literature review on the implementation of Artificial Intelligence in the field of business services was carried out. Only works indexed in the Web of Science database, published in the last 5 years, were selected. Moreover, the websites of the main developers and client companies were investigated. Our findings include a selection of identified AI solutions, structured by main business services categories; we have also outlined the performed tasks and the resulting benefits of each listed AI tool. The synopsis of AI-powered tools presented in the paper could serve professionals, managers and researchers in designing future policies, operational procedures and research approaches to cope with new challenges of disruptive technologies from the AI spectrum.

AB A successful implementation of artificial intelligence and robots in the service industry requires the acceptance and trust of consumers. In order to be able to provide similar services as human employees, AI devices and robots have to have the ability to interact and relate to the human consumer and, at the same time, to provide the expected information. Researches in the field of consumer services have shown that empathy and emotions can improve the relation between service employees and consumers, by providing more enjoyable interactions and a better exchange of information. In our research we investigate if the attachment between the consumer and AI devices can facilitate a higher quality of information exchange, a better and more pleasant interaction and if it determines a higher self-disclosing behavior from the consumer. Our results confirm that attachment has a positive impact on consumer-AI interactions, improving the perceived enjoyment of the conversation, a better quality of the exchanged information and determining a higher self-disclosing behavior. These results have important implications on the design of the future consumer-AI-interactions.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence has started to play an important role in digital marketing. Companies are increasingly using this technology to personalize content, improve the performance of marketing campaigns and user experience. According to a Google report published in 2021, Romania is one of the leading countries in Central and Eastern Europe in terms of significant growth in digital advertising expenditure. As a result, the current research aims to assess the importance and impact of AI usage in Romanian companies that activate in digital marketing. To conduct this study, an online survey was developed consisting of 11 questions to establish the utilization of AI in digital marketing and the perception of employees in companies towards this technology. The sample group was selected from a contact list of digital marketing firms, social media, and professional groups. Out of the total of 30 responses collected, valid data was analyzed to identify emerging trends and patterns in the use of AI in digital marketing. The survey findings indicate that AI is perceived as a valuable tool for enhancing user experience and increasing the effectiveness of digital marketing campaigns. It is important to consider the ethical and confidentiality implications when utilizing customer data, and to refrain from employing AI in a harmful or intrusive manner.

AB This paper presents research on precursors that can generate unique and attractive retail experiences when using artificial intelligence. Among them are safe technology, ethical aspects, and customer-friendly technology. The motivation for choosing this topic is that it gives a global, current perspective and arouses interest, curiosity, uncertainty, even fear. Quantitative research was implemented with the help of an online questionnaire. The conceptual model derived from the literature was then analysed through regression analysis. Data collected from 272 consumers allowed the research hypotheses to be validated. The results reveal that artificial intelligence applied in retail is the solution for achieving higher performance in the retail field, but without being used unethically. The results provide an overview of AI in retail today, with survey participants expressing confidence in AI's ability to improve their shopping experience. The originality of the research consists of approaching for the first time in the considered emerging market the perception of consumers toward the vectors that enhance their in-store shopping expectations. Considering the direction in which technology is evolving and based on the arguments of specialists, it can be stated that Artificial Intelligence will represent an element of distinction and competitive advantage. Companies in the retail sector that will invest in the development of Artificial Intelligence will benefit in the long term. Artificial intelligence should not be absent from the retail context, and further investment should be made in its development. The present study did not determine the actual purchase experience in virtual retail stores but was based on a hypothetical situation. Also, this study used a limited sample of respondents, with only Millennials participating. A future research perspective could be based on this study, but using a larger and more representative sample.

AB The author has carried out a research paper on how ERP systems have evolved, presenting their main characteristics, and conducting a debate between the benefits and challenges but also the opportunities of implementing such a system. Certainly, ERP systems have reached an absolute level of importance over time, being able to be compared with the backbone of the organizations where they are implemented. Research of the available specialized literature was carried out to find gaps in relation to the challenges and opportunities of implementing the three technologies Enterprise Resource Planning, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence in a single global system. After the study, it was concluded that by implementing a global system that integrates Enterprise Resource Planning, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence but also interconnects all the companies of the same supply flow, organizations can reach the highest level in terms of efficiency, forecast and monitoring but also perfect flexibility by adding Robotic Process Automation to the system. The results of this study complement specialized literature and make an important contribution to the field of study.

AB We address two major obstacles to practical deployment of AI-based models on distributed private data. Whether a model was trained by a federation of cooperating clients or trained centrally, (1) the output scores must be calibrated, and (2) performance metrics must be evaluated - all without assembling labels in one place. In particular, we show how to perform calibration and compute the standard metrics of precision, recall, accuracy and ROC-AUC in the federated setting under three privacy models (i) secure aggregation, (ii) distributed differential privacy, (iii) local differential privacy. Our theorems and experiments clarify tradeoffs between privacy, accuracy, and data efficiency. They also help decide if a given application has sufficient data to support federated calibration and evaluation.

AB Autonomous BVLOS Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gradually gaining their share in the drone market. Together with the demand for extended levels of autonomy comes the necessity for high-performance obstacle avoidance and navigation algorithms that will allow autonomous drones to operate with minimum or no human intervention. Traditional AI algorithms have been extensively used in the literature for finding the shortest path in 2-D or 3-D environments and navigating the drones successfully through a known and stable environment. However, the situation can become much more complicated when the environment is changing or not known in advance. In this work, we explore the use of advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to successfully navigate a drone within unspecified environments. We compare our approach against traditional AI algoriths in a set of validation experiments on a simulation environment, and the results show that using only a couple of low-cost distance sensors it is possible to successfully navigate the drone beyond the obstacles.

AB The SESAR-funded Modern ATM via Human / Automation Learning Optimisation (MAHALO) project recently completed two years of technical work exploring the human performance impacts of AI and Machine Learning (ML), as applied to enroute ATC conflict detection and resolution (CD&R). It first developed a hybrid ML CD&R capability, along with a realtime simulation platform and experimental User Interface. After a series of development trials, the project culminated in a pair of field studies (i.e., human-in-the-loop trials) across two EU countries, with a total of 35 operational air traffic controllers. In each of these two field studies, controller behaviour was first captured in a pre-test phase, and used to train the ML system. Subsequent main experiment trials then experimentally manipulated within controllers both Conformance (as either a personalised-, group average-, or optimized model) and Transparency (as ether a baseline vector depiction, an enhanced graphical diagram, or a diagramplus-text presentation). The proposed paper presents guidelines on the design and implementation of ML systems in Air Traffic Control, derived from the results and lesson learned from the Simulations, as well as the qualitative feedback received from the controllers themselves.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are widely used to improve the health monitoring tools exploited in aeronautics and this result in an increase in reliability and flight safety. Furthermore, better management of maintenance costs is another positive consequence of the application of AI-based health monitoring tools. In this paper, two AI-based health monitoring tools are developed to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a fleet of simple turbojet engines VIPER 632 - 43 subject to a compressor degradation process. The AI algorithms used in this work are the Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which are two types of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) particularly suitable for time-series forecasting. The data about engine operation in degraded condition necessary to develop the just cited tools are obtained by performing a series of simulations in transient condition in which a degraded state at the compressor is implemented. The Matlab&Simulink software, equipped with the T-MATS Simulink library developed by NASA is used to develop a virtual model of the VIPER 632 - 43 engine and to perform the simulation. Furthermore, an adequate mathematical model is used to simulate the trend of the degradation level during time.

ID ISSUES
AB Due to its potential uses across many industries, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is a developing field that has received a lot of interest. The open architecture and wireless connectivity of the IoD, however, render it susceptible to a number of security and privacy issues, such as data leaks, denial of service attacks, eavesdropping, and jamming. The security and privacy concerns of IoD are briefly discussed in this study. The study looks at the current security measures, including encryption, intrusion detection, and authentication, and how well they work to handle the security and privacy issues with IoD. The study also looks at new security paradigms like blockchain and AI and how they might improve the security and privacy of IoD. The findings of this study aim to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to design secure and efficient IoD networks, promote the safe and effective deployment of drone-based applications.

AB Cyberphysical systems with autonomous functions are complex pieces of software, consisting of many components, some of which implement autonomous functionality and some may use AI or machine learning algorithms. Software bugs in an autonomous system are of particular concern, as they can have catastrophic consequences. However, detailed studies based on empirical data are rare and therefore these bugs are not well understood. This paper aims to contribute towards filling that gap by investigating the software changes and bugs in Autonomy Operating System (AOS) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), which consist of 26 components containing about 103,000 lines of code and having a total of 772 bugfixes. Based on the data extracted from the code repository and semi-structured interviews with the developers of AOS, we explore the differences among autonomous software components, components developed using Model-based Software Engineering, and reuse with respect to change proneness, fault proneness, distribution of bugfixes among AOS components and files of these components, and characteristics of bugs of different AOS components. Our results show that the autonomous components were significantly more change prone (measured in number of commits and code churn) and fault prone (measured in bugfixes per KLoC) than non-autonomous components. The distribution of the locations of bugfixes was skewed, both at component and file level (i.e., a small number of components / files contained the majority of bugs). These evidence-based findings provide important insights to researchers and practitioners alike and can be used to efficiently improve the quality and reliability of autonomous systems.

DE Explainable AI; Explainability Evaluation; PCB AOI; Quantitative
   Approach
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used mainly for image classification because of their high accuracy and fast performance. Due to their complexity, their functionality is like a black box to the human user. Hence, this black box functionality may classify an image based on the wrong features, which can lead to severe consequences in critical applications, such as disease detection. Therefore, explainer methods provide the users with the reasoning behind each classification. However, selecting well-matching pairs of CNN models and explainers is challenging.
   This paper proposes a framework for automated explainability evaluation in CNN models, which follows a quantitative approach for assessing the model and explainer pairs. The proposed framework supersedes the previous attempts towards an explainability evaluation framework by replacing the time-consuming qualitative measure with a unified quantitative metric. This quantitative approach allows the users to assess several models and explainer pairs and compare the results based on two aspects on the one hand, selecting the most prominent model/explainer pair or, on the other hand, making compromises for better real-time performance. The framework is applied to a defect detection problem for printed circuit board assembly(PCBA) automatic optical inspection (AOI). The results are analyzed for thirteen built-in CNN models and ten built-in explainer methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of the "CoAtNet0" and "Grad-Cam selfmatch" pair with the 55.38% Explanation Score (ES) metric. The authors also provide a discussion on other criteria in the selection of a prominent pair using the proposed novel FACEE framework.

AB Shapley Values are established concepts used to explain local and global contribution of individual features to the prediction of AI models. Currently, global Shapley-based explainers do not consider the co-occurrences of feature-value pairs in the analyzed data. This paper proposes a novel approach to leverage the High-Utility Itemset Mining framework to jointly consider Shapley-based feature-level contributions and featurevalue pair co-occurrences. The results achieved on benchmark datasets show that the extracted patterns provide actionable knowledge, complementary to those of global Shapley Values.

   (LLMs); Generative Models; Social Media
AB The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in large language models and generative models, are reshaping the field of software engineering by enabling innovative ways of performing various tasks, such as programming, debugging, and testing. However, few existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of AI in code generation and users' attitudes toward AI-assisted coding tools. This knowledge gap leaves it unclear how AI is transforming software engineering and programming education. This paper presents a scalable crowdsourcing data-driven framework to investigate the code generation performance of generative large language models from diverse perspectives across multiple social media platforms. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT, a popular generative large language model, as a representative example to reveal its insights and patterns in code generation. First, we propose a hybrid keyword word expansion method that integrates words suggested by topic modeling and expert knowledge to filter relevant social posts of interest on Twitter and Reddit. Then we collect 316K tweets and 3.2K Reddit posts about ChatGPT's code generation, spanning from Dec. 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Our data analytics show that ChatGPT has been used in more than 10 programming languages, with Python and JavaScript being the two most popular, for a diverse range of tasks such as code debugging, interview preparation, and academic assignment solving. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that fear is the dominant emotion associated with ChatGPT's code generation, overshadowing emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and sadness. Furthermore, we construct a ChatGPT prompt and corresponding code dataset by analyzing the screen-shots of ChatGPT code generation shared on social media. This dataset enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated code, and we have released this dataset to the public. We believe the insights gained from our work will provide valuable guidance for future research on AI-powered code generation.

AB The main objective of authentic learning is to offer students an exciting and stimulating educational setting that provides practical experiences in tackling real-world security issues. Each educational theme is composed of pre-lab, lab, and post-lab activities. Through the application of authentic learning, we create and produce portable lab equipment for AI Security and Privacy on Google CoLab. This enables students to access and practice these hands-on labs conveniently and without the need for time-consuming installations and configurations. As a result, students can concentrate more on learning concepts and gain more experience in hands-on problem-solving abilities.

AB In this paper, we propose a general methodology for estimating the degree of the attribution methods precision and generality in machine learning interpretability. Additionally, we propose a technique to measure the attribution consistency between two attribution methods. In our experiments, we focus on the two well-known model agnostic attribution methods, SHAP and LIME, then we evaluate them on two real applications in the attack detection field. Our proposed methodology highlights the fact that both LIME and SHAP are lacking precision, generality, and consistency. Therefore, more inspection is needed in the attribution research field.

AB AI models deployed in real-world tasks (e.g., surveillance, implicit mapping, health care) typically need to be online trained for better modelling of the changing real-world environments and various online training methods (e.g., domain adaptation, few shot learning) are proposed for refining the AI models based on training input incrementally sampled from the real world. However, in the whole loop of AI model online training, there is a section rarely discussed: how to sample training input from the real world. In this paper, we show from the perspective of online training of AI models deployed on edge devices (e.g., robots) that several problems in sampling of training input on the device are affecting the time and energy consumption for the online training process to reach high performance. Notably, the online training relies on training input consecutively sampled from the real world and the consecutive samples from nearby states (e.g., position and orientation of a camera) are too similar and would limit the training accuracy gain per training iteration; on the other hand, while we can choose to sample more about the inaccurate samples to better final training accuracy, it is costly to obtain the accuracy statistics of samples via traditional ways such as validating, especially for AI models deployed on edge devices. These findings aim to raise research effort for practical online training of AI models, so that they can achieve resiliently and sustainably high performance in real-world tasks.

AB The new regulatory framework proposal on Artificial Intelligence (AI) published by the European Commission establishes a new risk-based legal approach. The proposal highlights the need to develop adequate risk assessments for the different uses of AI. This risk assessment should address, among others, the detection and mitigation of bias in AI. In this work we analyze statistical approaches to measure biases in automatic decision-making systems. We focus our experiments in face recognition technologies. We propose a novel way to measure the biases in machine learning models using a statistical approach based on the N-Sigma method. N-Sigma is a popular statistical approach used to validate hypotheses in general science such as physics and social areas and its application to machine learning is yet unexplored. In this work we study how to apply this methodology to develop new risk assessment frameworks based on bias analysis and we discuss the main advantages and drawbacks with respect to other popular statistical tests.

AB The adoption of AI systems has been widely used across multiple industry domains at an alerting rate without focusing on its ethical concerns. In order to address those concerns, an increasing number of AI ethics frameworks have been suggested recently, which focus on the algorithmic level rather than the systems level. Nonetheless, some system-level approaches mostly cover a single-level governance pattern of the system components in the entire software design life cycle. However, the need to go beyond the singlelevel system design AI ethics frameworks to allow not only a better responsible-AI-by-design but also a trustworthy process pattern that abstracts and links the underlying layers of responsible AI on every level. This paper illustrates a principal-to-practice guide of the multi-level governance within organizations across the globe for AI ethics frameworks. We outline the main gap areas in organizations for AI ethics frameworks. Consecutively, we propose a multi-level governance pattern for responsible AI systems within organizations which is participatory, iterative, flexible and operable that targets those main gap areas. Finally, to assist practitioners in applying the multi-level governance AI in organizations and its impact on the industry level, we will translate it into effective and responsible AI practices using a case study.

ID AI
AB Medical technologies bolstered by AI are quickly developing into viable options for actual clinical use. Wearable, smartphones, and other mobile monitoring sensors are producing vast amounts of data that can be processed by deep learning algorithms in a variety of medical settings. Patients are eager for augmented medicine to be implemented because it will give them more control over their care and allow them to receive more tailored treatment, but doctors are hesitant to embrace the shift because they are not equipped to deal with the resulting changes in clinical practice. In addition, this phenomenon raises the questions of whether or not these cutting-edge tools should be validated by conventional clinical trials, whether or not medical schools should update their curricula to reflect the rise of digital medicine, and whether or not the ethics of constant connected monitoring should be taken into account. The purpose of this paper is to explore the current research literature and offer a holistic view of the implications of well-established clinical applications of artificial intelligence on medical professionals, hospitals, medical schools, and bioethics.

This paper proposes RiskMan, an expert system for the automatic assessment of cyber risks that computes a risk score using information gathering and vulnerability assessment tools, public databases, and leaks from the dark web without involving cybersecurity experts. Moreover, RiskMan uses AI-driven techniques to determine risks also when only partial information is available.

AB Digital Twins (DTs) in Metaverse face many challenges such as the lack of optimized AI models to allow the interaction between the user and the virtual environment. In this paper, we propose an optimized model for human language processing based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNs) and we present an input processing strategy to meet the realtime requirements of smart applications that integrate DTs oriented to speech-based functionalities for user interaction and Metaverse. In our solution, CNNs are applied for the processing and classification of the human voice, while structured data and MFCC coefficients are used to train the neural networks and generate interference in the models. Similarly, the MFCC algorithm is provided to extract the unique characteristics that specify each generated audio file and to reduce the complexity of the neural network model in order to obtain better performance. Starting from an approach to the problem available in the literature, we have optimized a specific CNN model for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in order to increase effective results. The proposed model has demonstrated excellent performance and can be used as a basis for the implementation of software that allows the interaction of DTs with voice commands issued by a user.

AB In the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, the entire population of the world is getting affected either physically or mentally. In terms of physical diseases, the symptoms and treatments are more known, and people tend to be more aware of them. But the mental health is frequently ignored by general people, which has worsened during the pandemic. Though several research were conducted to cope with mental health analysis, detection and treatment in this current pandemic situation, the practical implementation are few. Among them the optimal results are produced by the ones adapting artificial intelligence (AI). Also, remote healthcare services have provided their supportive hands to combat the situation. In this paper, a systematic review of the use of AI and remote healthcare services has been conducted, which focuses on the detection, analysis and treatment of mental health among people during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current essence, challenges and limitations have also been discussed here. After evaluating the methods of data collection, usefulness and efficiency of the available works in symptom detection remotely and correctly, and data analysis algorithms used by them- a recommendation was made on the open research scopes in this field.

AB Current management of Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D) resorts to manual meal announcements from the patient to manage postprandial glycemia; nevertheless, suboptimal glycemic control is observed in real data, with the presence of many hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events. The utilization of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is paving the way for improved and automated glycemic control. A step in this direction is represented by the automation of meal detection, which would not require patients to perform tasks such as carbohydrate estimation and meal announcement that are error-prone, especially for children and elderly patients. In this work, we investigate several AI models for meal detection from in silico data of 10 adults, 10 adolescents, and 10 children with T1D using only CGM data, and compare them to the standard detection method based on the glycemic threshold. We generate 30 days of data per patient that include 5 meals per day and introduce human error on carbohydrate estimation to make data more similar to the real ones. The AI models can detect more than 81% of meals from any cohort of patients while producing a relatively small amount of false positives. The feedforward neural network, the support vector machine, and the threshold method are the most promising meal detection strategies for adult, adolescent, and child populations, respectively, and may improve patients' health and disease management.

AB The utility of ubiquitous computing systems drives large-scale software development with millions of lines of code (LOC). As there are vast code sets, it also increases the possibility of coding errors since it is difficult for even highly trained software engineers to write flawless code. Such flawed software can lead to severe issues once deployed. McCabe and Halstead proposed feature extractors for source code to define software quality. Based on the static features proposed by McCabe and Halstead, we run a series of feature engineering techniques and different machine learning models to detect code defects and use explainable algorithms to assess the prediction quality. We report different processing pipeline combinations to detect defects and compare the approaches. We conclude the paper with comments on the nature of the dataset and establish a baseline for further research.

AB This short paper presents preliminary results on the evaluation of a Classification Algorithms Framework Domain-Specific Language (CAF DSL) that was previously developed. In our previous work, a domain-specific language to provide a framework for choosing-evaluating classification algorithms but with a system-level and simplified interface approach was presented. However, the evaluation that took place was restricted to data scientists and language engineers. In this work, the evaluation of the same DSL but by finance-accountant professionals (domain-experts) took place in a small scale. The DSL was presented and feedback regarding its usability and learnability took place. Future plans consist of scaling this attempt further and extending it to different domains such as health care. The long-term plan consists of bringing AI - Classification algorithms to professionals and to the wider public.

AB The growth of information technology and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made data creation and usage more prevalent. AI research can be grouped into two categories: model-centric and data-centric. Model-centric AI focuses on using the same data and making changes to model hyper-parameters, architectures, and other configurations. Datacentric AI, on the other hand, prioritizes improving existing data or incorporating new data to improve the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms. Data-centric AI can greatly improve the performance of machine learning models by improving data quality, increasing data diversity, and using advanced data augmentation methods. The use of ML for early detection of mental health issues is vital due to its ability to identify issues early, provide personalized treatments, detect patterns, and increase accessibility to mental health services. While there have been numerous mental illness detection studies using model-centric approaches, there is a lack of research from a data-centric AI perspective. This study aims to address this gap by comparing established tabular data synthesis methods to explore the impact of synthetic data and data-centric AI on the early detection of mental health issues.

AB By minimizing human movement and contact, community isolation is an effective containment measure for the COVID-19 pandemic, especially against later strains that cause less severe symptoms. Nonetheless, a significant number of patients who enter community isolation with mild symptoms eventually develop severe pneumonias and require hospitalization. Therefore, the ability to foresee severe cases would be indispensable for managing limited medical resources. Here, we developed a proof-of-concept machine learning model, using daily vital signs data from 1,123 community isolation patients in Bangkok, Thailand, that can predict future hospitalization events up to 3 days in advance with an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.95. The model requires simple inputs, including body temperature, pulse rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and shortness of breath, that the patients can self-perform and report. Hence, our approach can aid clinicians in providing remote, proactive healthcare service in broad settings

AB Attention and working memory, which are two fundamental components of cognitive basis, can be improved through cognitive training. In addition, thanks to neuroplasticity, neurons are able to adapt quickly to the demands placed on them. By developing new neural networks and strengthening important connections, a cognitive training program can measurably and permanently improve brain activity. In this paper, we present a concept of AIoT based neural decoding and neurofeedback to accelerate cognitive training, the preliminary results and research directions. The proposed concept is to design adequate tiny machine learning to extract the relevant features and characteristics from physiological signals. A tiny ML performs classification or recognition of relevant patterns, based on which the neurofeedback system is appropriately designed for more effective cognitive training.

AB Aim To evaluate the buccal alveolar bone changes and the upper first molar displacement in subjects treated with conventional rapid maxillary expansion (RME), Ni-Ti leaf springs expander (Leaf Expander) and Tooth-Bone-borne Expander (Hybrid Expander) using CBCT scans. Methods The sample consisted of 52 children treated with RME (n=18), Leaf Expander (n= 17) and Hybrid Expander (n= 17). CBCTs were taken before and after maxillary expansion and the Horos software was used for the analysis. Descriptive statistics and paired t-test were used to assess changes between the pre-treatment and post-treatment measurements. ANOVA test and Tukey's post hoc test with Bonferroni correction was used for between groups comparison. Results The alveolar bone thickness at CEJ 3,5 and 10 decreased after expansion for all the three groups instead alveolar bone height had not significant variations. The ANOVA test showed a significant lower decrease of CJ3 and a greater amount of molar displacement concerning the DR variable in the Hybrid expander group. A significant buccal displacement of the first molars with increasing of DC and DR and decreasing of AI after the three expansion protocols was found. Conclusions The Hybrid Expander during preadolescence showed few advantages over the use of tooth-anchored expanders. An expansion approach with mini-screws is not preferable during early mixed dentition to a conventional approach. The differences in dental tipping values were clinically insignificant and the reduction in cortical bone thickness remained less than 1 mm. When possible, the use of second primary molars as anchorage should be preferred.

ID MULTIMEDIA
AB With the current complexification of image manipulation technologies (ranging from color editing or aspect ratio modifications to AI-generated fake news), many numerical representations can be connected to the same semantic visual content. Thus, ensuring trust and authenticity for tracking near-duplicated visual content (i.e., semantically identical yet digitally different content) becomes challenging from both methodological and technical points of view. Addressing these challenges requires the synergistic combination of methodological solutions from different research fields, while current solutions are heterogeneous and lack interoperability. In this paper, we create an automatic complete lifecycle management workflow for visual content assets represented on blockchains. The workflow is supported by a novel architecture seamlessly integrating near-duplicated content detection, Smart Contract automation, and token brokerage. The architecture leverages a load-balancing framework and near-duplicated content detection to grant properties natively featured by blockchains (security, trust, and transparency) to the authentication of assets in environments where the same semantic content has various digital representations. Subsequently, minted blockchain assets can be used contingently with other state-of-the-art tools, ensuring interoperability with blockchain working standards. The effectiveness of this workflow is demonstrated through open-source example implementations for the Ethereum and Tezos frameworks, illustrating the benefits this process brings to automatic asset generation and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) management.

DE Approximate inverse models; explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);
   feature importance; generalized inverse matrices; interpretability;
   model explanation techniques
AB Data-driven decision-making has become pervasive in the fields of interpretive machine learning and Explainable AI (XAI). While both fields aim to improve human comprehension of machine learning models, they differ in focus. Interpretive machine learning centers on deciphering outcomes in transparent, or 'glass-box,' models, whereas XAI focuses on creating tools for explaining complex 'black-box' models in a human-understandable way. Some existing interpretable machine learning and explainable AI methods have utilized a forward problem to derive how the prediction and estimation output results of a black-box model change with respect to the input. However, methods adopting the forward problem lead to non-intuitive explanations. Therefore, hypothesizing that the inverse problem can yield more intuitive explanations, we propose approximate inverse model explanations (AIME), which offer unified global and local feature importance by deriving approximate inverse operators for black-box models. Additionally, we introduce a representative instance similarity distribution plot, aiding comprehension of the predictive behavior of the model and target dataset. In our experiments with LightGBM, AIME proved effective across diverse data types, from tabular and handwritten digit images to text data. Results demonstrate that AIME's explanations are not only simpler but more intuitive than those generated by well-established methods like LIME and SHAP. It also visualizes similarity distribution with the target dataset, illustrating the relation between different predictions. Furthermore, AIME estimates local and global feature importance and provides fresh insights by visualizing the similarity distribution between representative estimation instances and the target dataset.

AB Cognitive automation powered by advanced intelligent technologies is increasingly enabling organizations to automate more of their knowledge work tasks. Although this often offers higher efficiency and lower costs, cognitive automation exacerbates the erosion of human skill and expertise in automated tasks. Accepting the erosion of obsolete skills is necessary to reap the benefits of technology-however, the erosion of essential human expertise is problematic if workers remain accountable for tasks for which they lack sufficient understanding, rendering them incapable of responding if the automation fails. Though the phenomenon is widely acknowledged, the dynamics behind such undesired skill erosion are poorly understood. Thus, taking the perspective of sociotechnical systems, we conducted a case study of an accounting firm that had experienced skill erosion over a number of years due to reliance on their software's automated functions. We synthesized our findings using causal loop modeling based on system dynamics. The resulting dynamic model explains skill erosion via an interplay between humans' automation reliance, complacency, and mindful conduction. It shows how increasing reliance on automation fosters complacency at both individual and organizational levels, weakening workers' mindfulness across three work task facets (activity awareness, competence maintenance, and output assessment), resulting in skill erosion. Such skill erosion may remain obscure, acknowledged by neither workers nor managers. We conclude by discussing the implications for theory and practice and identifying directions for future research.

AB The recent advent of highly accurate and scalable large language models (LLMs) has taken the world by storm. From art to essays to computer code, LLMs are producing novel content that until recently was thought only humans could produce. Recent work in computing education has sought to understand the capabilities of LLMs for solving tasks such as writing code, explaining code, creating novel coding assignments, interpreting programming error messages, and more. However, these technologies continue to evolve at an astonishing rate leaving educators little time to adapt. This working group seeks to document the state-of-the-art for code generation LLMs, detail current opportunities and challenges related to their use, and present actionable approaches to integrating them into computing curricula.

AB Mechanical engineering (ME) students have specific domain knowledge in developing physical systems, such as machines, vehicles and production equipment. Nevertheless, the strong demands of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for physical systems to become a cyber-physical system (CPS) is now a commonplace of modern physical systems. Hence, it is necessary to cultivate greater AI design and programming capabilities in ME students. In this poster, the "Intelligent Systems: Theory and Practice" course (ME5061 in ME, National Taiwan University) for senior undergraduate/ graduate students) is presented. This course has been offered once in the spring semester of 2022, and 34 students participated in this course.

AB The ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life suggests the need to ensure young students know about AI, its uses and limitations, and its benefits and risks, while enabling them to develop expertise in using AI-driven technologies. To support rural middle grades students and educators in learning and teaching AI concepts, we are designing AI-focused learning activities centered around the creation of digital gameplay experiences. To inform our designs, we conducted educator interviews and student focus groups to gain insights into their understanding of AI, their computer science background, and their knowledge and interest in gaming. Building on findings from these interviews and focus groups, we have designed a set of hands-on activities to elicit deeper feedback from students and educators on their preferences, points of confusion, and interests. In this work, we present our initial AI-infused game design activities.

AB .e growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping much of daily life..is in turn is raising awareness of the need to introduce AI education throughout the K-12 curriculum so that students can be.er understand and utilize AI. A particularly promising approach for engaging young learners in AI education is game-based learning. In this work, we present our efforts to embed a unit on AI planning within an immersive game-based learning environment for upper elementary students (ages 8 to 11) that utilizes a scaffolding progression based on the Use-Modify-Create framework. Further, we present how the scaffolding progression is being refined based on findings from piloting the game with students.

AB In this paper, I discuss what I call a new control problem related to AI in the form of humanoid robots, and I compare it to what I call the old control problem related to AI more generally. The old control problem - discussed by authors such as Alan Turing, Norbert Wiener, and Roman Yampolskiy - concerns a worry that we might lose control over advanced AI technologies, which is seen as something that would be instrumentally bad. The new control problem is that there might be certain types of AI technologies - in particular, AI technologies in the form of lifelike humanoid robots - where there might be something problematic, at least from a symbolic point of view, about wanting to completely control these robots. The reason for this is that such robots might be seen as symbolizing human persons and because wanting to control such robots might therefore be seen as symbolizing something non-instrumentally bad: persons controlling other persons. A more general statement of the new control problem is to say that it is the problem of describing under what circumstances having complete control over AI technologies is unambiguously good from an ethical point of view. This paper sketches an answer to this by also discussing AI technologies that do not take the form of humanoid robots and that are such that control over them can be conceptualized as a form of extended self-control.

AB So-called "killer robots", i.e., lethal autonomous weapon systems capable of selecting and attacking military targets without human intervention or control, are a particularly controversial topic in machine ethics. Many prominent AI researchers and scientists are calling for a ban of these devices. The paper will discuss three ethical objections against LAWS: (1) the argument from the responsibility gap (Sparrow), (2) the argument from human agency (Leveringhaus), and (3) the argument from moral duty ( Misselhorn). These three arguments raise fundament ethical concerns about LAWS. They are supposed to show that lethal autonomous weapon systems would not just have morally bad consequences but that the use of killer robots is morally wrong in itself.

AB As societies across the developed world are dealing with problems associated with aging populations, a promising solution in the form robotics technologies that support elderly people in their daily healthcare has emerged. However, emerging technology are like a double-edge sword. Although healthcare robots can be used for elderly and disabled people with different levels of assistive supports, ie by monitoring their real time health for prompt interaction or by communicating with people to reduce their anxiety, they also bring with them many concerns from an ethical, legal and societal perspective. Among them, one serious issue is privacy and data protection. When healthcare robots are powered by machine learning and distributed databases, "data-driven" networked healthcare robots will be able to gather a huge amount of personal data in physical environments through their interactions with humans. There are several alternative approaches of data protection for "data-driven" networked healthcare robots, including privacy by design, de-identification of data and informed consent. In this article our focus is on the issue of informed consent in human-robot interaction. My argument is that specific conditions of intelligent robots (i.e., embodiment) will mean that the principle of informed consent cannot just be copied and applied to "data-driven" networked healthcare robots. I will make the comparison of the two types of informed consent to clarify our targeted "informed consent in human-robot interaction". Furthermore, there is a need to discuss potential legal conflicts of this new type of informed consent when it is applied to different countries and their respective legal regimes. Hence, in this article I will conduct a comparative legal analysis of European, American and Japanese data protection law to investigate how such differences might influence the implementation of informed consent to data-driven healthcare robots.

AB How do we develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems that adhere to the norms and values of our human practices? Is it a promising idea to develop systems based on the principles of normative frameworks such as consequentialism, deontology, or virtue ethics? According to many researchers in machine ethics - a subfield exploring the prospects of constructing moral machines - the answer is yes. In this paper, I challenge this methodological strategy by exploring the difference between normative ethics - its use and abuse in human practices and in the context of machines. First, I discuss the purpose of normative theory in human contexts; its main strengths and drawbacks. I then describe several moral resources central to the success of normative ethics in human practices. I argue that machines, currently and in the foreseeable future, lack the resources needed to justify the very use of normative theory. Instead, I propose that machine ethicists should pay closer attention to the multifaceted ways normativity serves and functions in human practices, and how artificial systems can be designed and deployed to foster the moral resources that allow such practices to prosper.

DE creativity; AI; art; Boden; autonomy; intentionality; valuation
AB Are creativity and artificial intelligence contradictions in terms? Margaret Boden argues that a creative product is one that is "surprising" as a result of the combination, exploration, or transformation involved in producing it. Boden uses examples of artificial intelligence systems that fit all of these criteria, but then argues that "real" creativity involves autonomy, intentionality, valuation, emotion, and consciousness. I analyse Boden's position and argue that her argument is problematic as a result of the anthropocentrism implicit in the bifurcated definition she sets up. Contrary to Boden, I propose that we need not jealously guard creativity as an ability that is exclusively held by humans. I suggest we rather reject the anthropocentric conception of agenthood as problematic within our understandings of creativity. In my view, it is possible to grant (some) non-human agents entry into the realm of creativity, without undermining the value of the artifacts and ideas created, and without undermining the worth and dignity of our humanness

ID DESIGN
AB Among the newest directions of research in the last few years, renewed interest in religion took place in the robotics community. Pioneering this interest, SanTO was the first ever Catholic robot to be made. Its realisation went together with the necessity of revising the theoretical bases that should properly identify what are SanTO and other robots of this kind. Its media coverage and later employment acted as a Pandora's box of potential ethical problems, which range from blasphemy to incompatibility with science, through dangers of nudging, AI bias, privacy and more. This paper analyses the main issues and how they were addressed, and the future direction of research leads to the development of the new model, CelesTE, aiming to a more pronounced ethical design.

AB Although even very advanced artificial systems do not meet the demanding conditions which are required for humans to be a proper participant in a social interaction, we argue that not all human-machine interactions (HMIs) can appropriately be reduced to mere tool-use. By criticizing the far too demanding conditions of standard construals of intentional agency we suggest a minimal approach that ascribes minimal agency to some artificial systems resulting in the proposal of taking minimal joint actions as a case of a social HMI. Analyzing such HMIs, we utilize Dennett's stance epistemology, and argue that taking either an intentional stance or design stance can be misleading for several reasons, and instead propose to introduce a new stance that is able to capture social HMIs-the AI-stance.

AB Can we build machines with which we can have interesting conversations? Observing the new optimism of AI regarding deep learning and new language models, we set ourselves an ambitious goal: We want to find out how far we can get in creating a digital replica of a philosopher. This project has two aims; one more technical, investigating of how the best model can be built. The other one, more philosophical, exploring the limitations and risks which accompany the creation of digital replicas. In cooperation with Daniel Dennett, we took his complete works to fine-tune a GPT-3. In this paper we share our first results with some piloting models and discuss legal and ethical questions about creating and interacting with digital replicas.

AB To address the tension between demands for more transparent AI systems and the aim to develop and design robots with apparent agency for smooth and intuitive human-robot interaction (HRI), we present in this paper an argument for why explainability in HRI would benefit from being question-centered. First, we review how explainability has been discussed in AI and HRI respectively, to then present the challenge in HRI to accommodate the requirement of transparency while also keeping up the appearance of the robot as a social agent. Based on the conceptualization of questions as information-seeking acts, our proposal for a question-centered approach to explainable HRI (xHRI) implies that to ensure transparency, robots shall provide explanations upon request in the form of questioning. We end this paper by laying out a preliminary taxonomy of xHRI-relevant questions that present the kinds of explanations a robot can or should be able to provide for successful and transparent HRI.

AB It is typically argued that robots cannot meet the conditions of moral responsibility. Thus, where robots are involved in morally significant harm, troubling responsibility gaps are thought to arise. In this paper, it is argued that the responsibility gap concept is itself founded on false premises-that traditional settings afford us with clear-cut moral culprits whom it is fair and beneficial to hold accountable, and that our responsibility practices are straightforwardly morally and socially desirable. There are morally and socially desirable outcomes of our responsibility practices worth fighting for-dependable, responsible social behavior, acts of repair, restoration, and reformation. However, not only can these outcomes be extended beyond traditional contexts to technologically advanced domains, they can be enhanced as well.

DE robot rights; neo-aylorism; relational turn; Luddite turn
AB The robot rights scholarly debate has outpaced debates concerning pressing societal issues related to the repressive robotic enslavement of humans. Clearly, the robot rights debate can co-exist with critical political discussions in robophilosophy. However, in academia, we do not reside in an isolated philosophical bubble. Our voices are echoed in the society's debates on AI and robots. Here, the public opinion and policy making is poorly informed and shaped by techno-optimistic and, often, false and overconfident predictions about the capabilities of AI and robots. Therefore, we should be cautious when insisting on continuously advancing the robot rights debate. Explorations of this exotic topic attracts media attention and intensifies common sci-fi myths and misperceptions tied to the public debate on AI and robots. Consequently, we should cease discussing whether robots ought to be included in the moral circle. We have more pressing, but less media catchy issues to discuss as robots increasingly enslave humans. Consequently, it is time to face the challenges of neo-tayloristic robot tyranny. It is time to replace the relational turn of the robot ethics debate with a Luddite turn.

"Robotic home" is an integrated system of smart home and robotic technologies that is proactive and interactive with the inhabitant. We focus on the possibility of such technology to be used for enhancing mental health. This could be achieved both through therapeutic functions and by assisting in the aspects of regular life that the inhabitant may have difficulties with because of their condition. Technology like this could make the very home effectively a behavioral therapist. Furthermore, we explore what kind of ethical risks are involved, and how to minimize the risks.

AB This paper introduces the idea of a robotic home and discusses some ethical aspects of the design for it. "Robotic home" is a version of smart home where the AI systems and the physical devices they control form a functionally integrated whole that is active towards the inhabitant(s). While a smart home has AI applications mainly as tools for convenience, a robotic home is a cluster of both embodied (robotic) and disembodied AI systems that interact with the inhabitant(s) of the home. The context for the discussion is an environment that is designed to assist a person who requires active assistance for everyday life (for instance, for mental health reasons, disability, or old age), and the home itself takes over some functions that enable the everyday life in a desired way. A living environment such as this should be a coherent, functional whole where the different parts of the design serve the specific needs of the inhabitant, as well as moral values such as dignity and autonomy. Aimee Van Wynsberghe's care centred value-sensitive design model of care robotics is discussed as a starting point for developing a practical ethical framework for designing this environment, including the analysis of personalized needs for assistance, (physical and non-physical) tasks that the robotic home is responsible of, and ethical considerations.

AB Theories of extended cognition and AI- extenders offer useful theoretical tools for investigating hybrid systems, where cognitive capacities are enhanced or substituted with technological means. In the "extended" view, the integrated technologies are considered as part of their users' cognition and agency and hence should be given a stronger ethical and legal status. This paper focuses on cognitive technologies such as smart home technologies that can maintain mental health and activities of daily living, and suggests that the extended view offers an advantageous and more ethical way to view them.

AB It is possible that there are good reasons not to recognise a legal personality for autonomous systems, but there are none for not deepening the debate. On 16 February 2017, the European Parliament asked the Commission to explore the possibility of recognising a specific legal status for robots, so that at least the most sophisticated autonomous robots could be held as electronic persons liable for compensation for the damage they cause. The reaction has been one of complete closure. However, there are several good reasons to critically re- examine the reasons for this opposition in the light of both civil and criminal liability.

DE audio; accessibility; occupancy; privacy; smart buildings
AB Audio AI services present an opportunity to conceptualise smart buildings in a new light. Microphones can capture fine-grained audio information that can be used for determining how many people are inside of a building, where they are, and what kinds of activities are taking place. This information can feed into smart resource management systems or it could be used for assistive technologies. Generally speaking, audio is regarded as a less intrusive type of information collection than video surveillance, but significant issues of privacy and security persist with audio capture. Such issues warrant a serious discussion about how safe it is to use audio-capture in smart buildings for AI decision-making. This position paper initiates a discussion of research directions for the safety of audio services related to three key areas: data degradation strategies, dynamic customisation of tools, and privacy-aware technologies. In each area, we identify key challenges and highlight solution concepts with the potential to address the issue.

AB The advent of IoT, ubiquitous and smart sensing and high-performance computing has resulted in a big shift in the adoption of data-driven black-box modelling (also referred to as machine/deep learning) to make our environments smarter and energy systems efficient. Several studies have shown that these AI-enabled solutions for smart buildings, smart cities, smart grids, and electric transportation, among others, are much more accurate and efficient. However, these data-driven black-box solutions are rarely held accountable for the impact of their actions on the human in the loop which significantly impacts their real-world adoption. To truly conceptualize the idea of smart systems for everyone, it is critical to study these AI-enabled smart environments and energy systems for not just efficiency, but also for affordability and accessibility for all. The first ACM SIGEnergy workshop on Fair, Accountable, Transparent, and Ethical AI for Smart Environments and Energy Systems intends to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds and discuss key issues, challenges, breakthroughs, and socioeconomic impact in developing fair, accountable, transparent and ethical AI techniques for smart environments and energy systems.

AB Benchmarking energy usage help identify operational and strategic best practices suitable for an establishment while creating awareness of energy consumption. Therefore in this work, we present XENIA, a data-driven energy benchmarking methodology for buildings in Singapore using a public dataset of building attributes. We develop an ensemble tree model to predict energy consumption using the building attributes as predictors. Symmetric mean absolute percentage error of these models for hotel and retail buildings is 5.15% and 5.02%, respectively. A benchmark grade is then assigned to each building using the actual and predicted energy consumption. To interpret the model, we provide a global explanation using the partial dependence function to show the effect of building attributes on energy consumption. For local explanation, i.e., for a specific building, we use the SHAP value to show the influence of each building attribute in the prediction model. The results for hotels and retail buildings show that change in AC and non-AC floor has the highest positive impact on energy consumption.

AB Secure software development has become an increasingly important focus for research in recent years, not least because of advances in technology such as AI, machine learning (AI/ML), robotics, and autonomous systems (RAS). AI/ML and RAS facilitate automated decision-making and have the capability to have a significant impact on society. As such this technology needs to be trustworthy, and secure software development is a key attribute for trustworthiness. Software developers frequently have responsibility and accountability for delivering secure code but limited authority over how this is achieved. Authority tends to lie with cyber security professionals who mandate security processes, tools and training, often with limited success. Our research objective was to better understand how to bridge this gap between software developers and cyber security practitioners so that authority, responsibility and accountability are shared equally. We took inspiration from healthcare research that looks at the relationship between compliance, adherence and concordance. We use this research as a lens through which to analyse qualitative data from 35 interviews with professional software developers. Our research suggests that if software developers and cyber security professionals move to a point of concordance in their interactions it could lead to the negotiation of more realistic cyber security solutions, as well as removing friction from the practice of software developers and ultimately lead to more secure and trustworthy systems.

AB In today's IT environment with a growing number of costly outages, increasing complexity of the systems, and availability of massive operational data, there is a strengthening demand to effectively leverage Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) towards enhanced resiliency. In this paper, we present an automatic fault injection platform to enable and optimize the generation of data needed for building AI/ML models to support modern IT operations. The merits of our platform include the ease of use, the possibility to orchestrate complex fault scenarios and to optimize the data generation for the modeling task at hand. Specifically, we designed a fault injection service that (i) combines fault injection with data collection in a unified framework, (ii) supports hybrid and multi-cloud environments, and (iii) does not require programming skills for its use. Our current implementation covers the most common fault types both at the application and infrastructure levels. The platform also includes some AI capabilities. In particular, we demonstrate the interventional causal learning capability currently available in our platform. We show how our system is able to learn a model of error propagation in a micro-service application in a cloud environment (when the communication graph among micro-services is unknown and only logs are available) for use in subsequent applications such as fault localization.

AB AI-enabled software systems (AIS) are prevalent in a wide range of applications, such as visual tasks of autonomous systems, extensively deployed in automotive, aerial, and naval domains. Hence, it is crucial for humans to evaluate the model's intelligence before AIS is deployed to safety-critical environments, such as public roads.
   In this paper, we assess AIS visual intelligence through measuring the completeness of its perception of primary concepts in a domain and the concept variants. For instance, is the visual perception of an autonomous detector mature enough to recognize the instances of pedestrian (an automotive domain's concept) in Halloween customes? An AIS will be more reliable once the model's ability to perceive a concept is displayed in a human-understandable language. For instance, is the pedestrian in wheelchair mistakenly recognized as a pedestrian on bike, since the domain concepts bike and wheelchair, both associate with a mutual feature wheel?
   We answer the above-type questions by implementing a generic process within a framework, called B-AIS, which systematically evaluates AIS perception against the semantic specifications of a domain, while treating the model as a black-box. Semantics is the meaning and understanding of words in a language, and therefore, is more comprehensible for humans' brains than the AIS pixel-level visual information. B-AIS processes the heterogeneous artifacts to be comparable, and leverages the comparison's results to reveal AIS weaknesses in a human-understandable language. The evaluations of B-AIS for the two vision tasks of pedestrian and aircraft detection showed a F-2 measure of 95% and 85% as well as 45% and 72% respectively in the dataset and model for the detection of pedestrian and aircraft variants.

AB Automatically fixing compilation errors can greatly raise the productivity of software development, by guiding the novice or AI programmers to write and debug code. Recently, learning-based program repair has gained extensive attention and became the state-of-the-art in practice. But it still leaves plenty of space for improvement. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution TransRepair to locate the error lines and create the correct substitute for a C program simultaneously. Superior to the counterpart, our approach takes into account the context of erroneous code and diagnostic compilation feedback. Then we devise a Transformer-based neural network to learn the ways of repair from the erroneous code as well as its context and the diagnostic feedback. To increase the effectiveness of TransRepair, we summarize 5 types and 74 fine-grained sub-types of compilations errors from two real-world program datasets and the Internet. Then a program corruption technique is developed to synthesize a large dataset with 1,821,275 erroneous C programs. Through the extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TransRepair outperforms the state-of-the-art in both single repair accuracy and full repair accuracy. Further analysis sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses in the contemporary solutions for future improvement.

ID SENSITIVITY
AB Microservices Architecture (MSA) has become a de-facto standard for designing cloud-native enterprise applications due to its efficient infrastructure setup, service availability, elastic scalability, dependability, and better security. Existing (monolithic) systems must be decomposed into microservices to harness these characteristics. Since manual decomposition of large scale applications can be laborious and error-prone, AI-based systems to decompose applications are gaining popularity. However, the usefulness of these approaches is limited by the expressiveness of the program representation and their inability to model the application's dependency on critical external resources such as databases. Consequently, partitioning recommendations offered by current tools result in architectures that result in (a) distributed monoliths, and/or (b) force the use of (often criticized) distributed transactions. This work attempts to overcome these challenges by introducing CARGO (short for Context-sensitive lAbel pRopaGatiOn)-a novel un-/semi-supervised partition refinement technique that uses a context- and flow-sensitive system dependency graph of the monolithic application to refine and thereby enrich the partitioning quality of the current state-of-the-art algorithms. CARGO was used to augment four state-of-the-art microservice partitioning techniques (comprised of 1 industrial tool and 3 open-source projects). These were applied on five Java EE applications (comprised of 1 proprietary and 4 open source projects). Experiments show that CARGO is capable of improving the partition quality of all four partitioning techniques. Further, CARGO substantially reduces distributed transactions, and a real-world performance evaluation of a benchmark application (deployed under varying loads) shows that CARGO also lowers the overall the latency of the deployed microservice application by 11% and increases throughput by 120% on average.

[Overall Research Problem:] Most studies with automated intelligent toolchains report uncertainty and evaluations only of the individual components of the chain. How do we calculate the uncertainty and error propagation on the overall automated toolchain? [Approach:] I plan to replicate research case studies to collect data and design a methodology to reconstruct the overall correctness metrics of the toolchains, or identifying missing variables. Further confirmatory experiments with humans will be performed. Finally, I will implement an artifact to automate the overall assessment of automated toolchains. [Current Status:] A preliminary validation of published studies showed promising results.

ID TEST DATA GENERATION
AB Software testing is a process of evaluating and verifying whether a software product still works as expected, and it is repetitive, laborious, and time-consuming. To address this problem, automation tools have been developed to automate testing activities and enhance quality and delivery time. However, automation tools become less effective with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines when the system under test is constantly changing. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) present the potential for addressing important challenges in test automation. AI/ML can be applied to automate various testing activities such as detecting bugs and errors, maintaining existing test cases, or generating new test cases much faster than humans.
   In this study, we will outline testing activities where AI has significantly impacted and greatly enhanced the testing process. Based on that, we identify primary AI techniques that are used in each testing activity. Further, we conduct a comprehensive study of test automation tools to provide a clear look at the role of AI/ML technology in industrial testing tools. The results of this paper help researchers and practitioners understand the current state of AI/ML applied to software testing, which is the first important step towards achieving successful and efficient software testing.

AB Question answering (QA) software uses information retrieval and natural language processing techniques to automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. Like other AI-based software, QA software may contain bugs. To automatically test QA software without human labeling, previous work extracts facts from question answer pairs and generates new questions to detect QA software bugs. Nevertheless, the generated questions could be ambiguous, confusing, or with chaotic syntax, which are unanswerable for QA software. As a result, a relatively large proportion of the reported bugs are false positives. In this work, we proposed QAQA, a sentence-level mutation based metamorphic testing technique for QA software. To eliminate false positives and achieve precise automatic testing, QAQA leverages five Metamorphic Relations (MRs) as well as semantics-guided search and enhanced test oracles. Our evaluation on three QA datasets demonstrates that QAQA outperforms the state-of-the-art in both quantity (8,133 vs. 6,601 bugs) and quality (97.67% vs. 49% true positive rate) of the reported bugs. Moreover, the test inputs generated by QAQA successfully reduce MR violation rate from 44.29% to 20.51% when being adopted in fine-tuning the QA software under test.

AB Contemporary DNN testing works are frequently conducted using metamorphic testing (MT). In general, de facto MT frameworks mutate DNN input images using semantics-preserving mutations and determine if DNNs can yield consistent predictions. Nevertheless, we find that DNNs may rely on erroneous decisions (certain components on the DNN inputs) to make predictions, which may still retain the outputs by chance. Such DNN defects would be neglected by existing MT frameworks. Erroneous decisions, however, would likely result in successive mis-predictions over diverse images that may exist in real-life scenarios.
   This research aims to unveil the pervasiveness of hidden DNN defects caused by incorrect DNN decisions (but retaining consistent DNN predictions). To do so, we tailor and optimize modern eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to identify visual concepts that represent regions in an input image upon which the DNN makes predictions. Then, we extend existing MT-based DNN testing frameworks to check the consistency of DNN decisions made over a test input and its mutated inputs. Our evaluation shows that existing MT frameworks are oblivious to a considerable number of DNN defects caused by erroneous decisions. We conduct human evaluations to justify the validity of our findings and to elucidate their characteristics. Through the lens of DNN decision-based metamorphic relations, we re-examine the effectiveness of metamorphic transformations proposed by existing MT frameworks. We summarize lessons from this study, which can provide insights and guidelines for future DNN testing.

AB Understanding binary code is an essential but complex software engineering task for reverse engineering, malware analysis, and compiler optimization. Unlike source code, binary code has limited semantic information, which makes it challenging for human comprehension. At the same time, compiling source to binary code, or transpiling among different programming languages (PLs) can provide a way to introduce external knowledge into binary comprehension. We propose to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that aid human comprehension of binary code. Specifically, we propose to incorporate domain knowledge from large corpora of source code (e.g., variable names, comments) to build AI models that capture a generalizable representation of binary code. Lastly, we will investigate metrics to assess the performance of models that apply to binary code by using human studies of comprehension.

AB The size of deep learning models in artificial intelligence (AI) software is increasing rapidly, which hinders the large-scale deployment on resource-restricted devices (e.g., smartphones). To mitigate this issue, AI software compression plays a crucial role, which aims to compress model size while keeping high performance. However, the intrinsic defects in the big model may be inherited by the compressed one. Such defects may be easily leveraged by attackers, since the compressed models are usually deployed in a large number of devices without adequate protection. In this paper, we try to address the safe model compression problem from a safety-performance co-optimization perspective. Specifically, inspired by the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm in software engineering, we propose a test-driven sparse training framework called SafeCompress. By simulating the attack mechanism as the safety test, SafeCompress can automatically compress a big model to a small one following the dynamic sparse training paradigm. Further, considering a representative attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA), we develop a concrete safe model compression mechanism, called MIA-SafeCompress. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate MIA-SafeCompress on five datasets for both computer vision and natural language processing tasks. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of our method. We also discuss how to adapt SafeCompress to other attacks besides MIA, demonstrating the flexibility of SafeCompress.

AB Optical communication networks represent a fast-growing field in communication technol-ogy with numerous optimization and advancements to improve communication efficiency between systems. Introducing AI into various fields plays a key role in advancing optical network communication (ONC), comprising physical, data transmission, network, applica-tion, and transport layers. All these layers consist of several parameters, which should be optimized to provide better overall ONC. These layers must be dynamically optimized as they provide real-time data. AI algorithms can be programmed to optimize the parameters of different layers in ONC, like those, which involve the Quality of Transmission (QoT) parameters, and provide a better network. The QoT of OCN entirely depends on the net-work parameters and determined traffic data. The traffic data is determined by optimizing the network parameters. Thus, a Hybrid Q-Learning Artificial Neural Network (Q(L) ANN) model is proposed in this study to improve the QoT of OCN. The Q-Learning model pre-processes the network parameters and determines the traffic data. Based on the optimized traffic data, the ANN improves the QoT of OCN. The output of the Q-Learning model feeds into ANN as an input. In comparison, the ANN is trained with traffic data and net-work parameters and improves the QoT of the network. The performance of Q(L) ANN model is evaluated by comparing and verifying its performance with the existing models. The comparison results showed that the Q(L) ANN model provides better QoT than the tra-ditional models, and it uses AI to improve the network's performance more efficiently. The Q(L) ANN model obtained 99.5% accuracy with 96% of success transmission and proved efficient.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning (including generative AI) are increasingly being investigated in the context of research and management of human infection. Objectives: We summarise recent and potential future applications of AI and its relevance to clinical infection practice.Methods: 1617 PubMed results were screened, with priority given to clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This narrative review focusses on studies using prospectively collected real-world data with clinical validation, and on research with translational potential, such as novel drug discovery and micro-biome-based interventions. Results: There is some evidence of clinical utility of AI applied to laboratory diagnostics (e.g. digital culture plate reading, malaria diagnosis, antimicrobial resistance profiling), clinical imaging analysis (e.g. pul-monary tuberculosis diagnosis), clinical decision support tools (e.g. sepsis prediction, antimicrobial pre-scribing) and public health outbreak management (e.g. COVID-19). Most studies to date lack any real-world validation or clinical utility metrics. Significant heterogeneity in study design and reporting limits com-parability. Many practical and ethical issues exist, including algorithm transparency and risk of bias.Conclusions: Interest in and development of AI-based tools for infection research and management are undoubtedly gaining pace, although the real-world clinical utility to date appears much more modest.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Tiny Deep Learning Models offer many advantages in various applications. From the perspective of statistical machine learning theory the contributions of this paper is to complement the research advances and results obtained so far in real-time 3D object recognition. We propose a Tiny Deep Learning Model named Complementary Spatial Transformer Network (CSTN) for Real-Time 3D object recognition. It turns out that CSTN's working, and analysis are much simplified in a target space setting. We make algorithmic enhancements to perform CSTN computations faster and keep the learning part of CSTN in minimal size. Finally, we provide the experimental verifications of the results obtained in publicly available point cloud data sets ModelNet40 and ShapeNetCore with our model performing 1.65-2 times better in DPS (Detections/s) rate on GPU hardware for 3D object recognition, when compared to state-of-the-art networks. Complementary Spatial Transformer Network architecture requires only 10-35% of trainable parameters, when compared to state-of-the-art networks, making the network easier to deploy in edge AI devices.

AB The rapid growth of CMOS logic circuits has surpassed the advancements in memory access, leading to significant "memory wall" bottlenecks, particularly in artificial intelligence applications. To address this challenge, compute-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the performance, area efficiency, and energy efficiency of computing systems. By enabling memory cells to perform parallel computations, CIM improves data reuse and minimizes data movement between the memory and the processor. This study conducts a comprehensive review of various domains of SRAM-based CIM macros and their associated computing paradigms. Additionally, it presents a survey of recent SRAM-CIM macros, with a specific focus on the key challenges and design tradeoffs involved. Furthermore, this research identifies potential future trends in SRAM-CIM macro-level design, including hybrid computing, precision enhancement, and operator reconfiguration. These trends aim to resolve the tradeoff between computational accuracy, energy efficiency, and support for diverse operators within the SRAM-CIM framework. At the microarchitecture level, two possible solutions for tradeoffs are proposed: chiplet integration and sparsity optimization. Finally, research perspectives are proposed for future development.

AB The quaternary structure with specific stoichiometry is pivotal to the specific function of protein complexes. However, determining the structure of many protein complexes experimentally remains a major bottleneck. Structural bioinformatics approaches, such as the deep learning algorithm Alphafold2-multimer (AF2-multimer), leverage the co-evolution of amino acids and sequence-structure relationships for accurate de novo structure and contact prediction. Pseudo-likelihood maximization direct coupling analysis (plmDCA) has been used to detect co-evolving residue pairs by statistical modeling. Here, we provide evidence that combining both methods can be used for de novo prediction of the quaternary structure and stoichiometry of a protein complex. We achieve this by augmenting the existing AF2-multimer confidence metrics with an interpretable score to identify the complex with an optimal fraction of native contacts of co-evolving residue pairs at intermolecular interfaces. We use this strategy to predict the quaternary structure and non-trivial stoichiometries of Bacillus subtilis spore germination protein complexes with unknown structures. Co-evolution at intermolecular interfaces may therefore synergize with AI-based de novo quaternary structure prediction of structurally uncharacterized bacterial protein complexes.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping consumer interaction with brands, but little is known about how brands can implement AI tools effectively. Drawing on consumer uniqueness and self-construal theories, the authors examine the implementation of branded AI tools and their influence on consumers' experience, sense of uniqueness, and spending behavior. Across five studies, this research examines consumers' narratives about interacting with a branded AI tool (Study 1); tests the relationships between self-construal, AI-enabled consumer experiences, and avoidance of similarity (Studies 2A and 2B); evaluates in situ experience with a branded AI tool and its implications for spending behavior (Study 3); and delineates consumer preferences about the attributes of branded AI tools (Study 4). The findings reveal that individuals characterized by independent self-construal are prone toward perceiving higher recognition and hedonic values during their experience with branded AI tools, partially enhancing consumer avoidance of similarity and influencing their willingness to pay for products that the AI tool recommends. For practitioners, the findings suggest developing a two-fold value proposition strategy for consumers by generating personal and psychological value together with product and service recommendations.

AB In the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, which aims to cultivate problem-solving skills, accurately assessing learners' engagement remains a significant challenge. We present a solution to this issue with the Real-time Automated STEM Engagement Detection System (RASEDS). This innovative system capitalizes on the power of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive (ICAP) framework. RASEDS uses You Only Learn One Representation (YOLOR) to detect and map learners' interactions onto the four levels of engagement delineated in the ICAP framework. This process informs the system's recommendation of adaptive learning materials, designed to boost both engagement and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Our study affirms that RASEDS accurately gauges engagement, and that the subsequent use of these adaptive materials significantly enhances both engagement and self-efficacy. Importantly, our research suggests a connection between elevated self-efficacy and increased engagement. As learners become more engaged in their learning process, their confidence is bolstered, thereby augmenting self-efficacy. We underscore the transformative potential of AI in facilitating adaptive learning in STEM education, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between engagement and self-efficacy.

ID TRIAGE
AB ObjectiveArtificial intelligence (AI) has gradually found its way into healthcare, and its future integration into clinical practice is inevitable. In the present study, we evaluate the accuracy of a novel AI algorithm designed to predict admission based on a triage note after clinical implementation. This is the first of such studies to investigate real-time AI performance in the emergency setting.MethodsThe novel AI algorithm that predicts admission using a triage note was translated into clinical practice and integrated within St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne's electronic emergency patient management system. The data were collected from 1 January 2021 to 17 August 2022 to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the AI system after implementation.ResultsA total of 77 125 ED presentations were included. The live AI algorithm has a sensitivity of 73.1% (95% confidence interval 72.5-73.8), specificity of 74.3% (73.9-74.7), positive predictive value of 50% (49.6-50.4) and negative predictive value of 88.7% (88.5-89) with a total accuracy of 74% (73.7-74.3). The accuracy of the system was at the lowest for admission to psychiatric units (34%) and at the highest for gastroenterology and medical admission (84% and 80%, respectively).ConclusionOur study showed the diagnostic evaluation of a real-time AI clinical decision-support tool became less accurate than the original. Although real-time sensitivity and specificity of the AI tool was still acceptable as a decision-support tool in the ED, we propose that continuous training and evaluation of AI-enabled clinical support tools in healthcare are conducted to ensure consistent accuracy and performance to prevent inadvertent consequences.
   Live artificial intelligence (AI) model performance may differ in comparison to the original trained and tested model. Frequent assessment of the accuracy and performance of any integrated AI model with an electronic medical record is crucial to ensure upholding of defined diagnostic evaluation of the system after implementation. Integration of the electronic medical records and AI system can add value proposition in clinical practice by reducing cognitive load on clinicians and mitigating risk.image

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have increasingly become vital in our everyday lives. Education is one of the most visible domains in which these technologies are being used. Conversational Agents (CAs) are among the most prominent AI systems for assisting teaching and learning processes. Their integration into an e-learning system can provide replies suited to each learner's specific needs, allowing them to study at their own pace. In this paper, based on recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, we present an experimental implementation of an educational chatbot intended to instruct secondary school learners Logo, an educational programming language. The related chatbot was implemented and evaluated in Moroccan public schools with the support of teachers from the Regional Center for Education and Training Professions of Souss Massa. The experiments included 109 students grouped into three separate classes. One is a control class group that uses a traditional approach, while the other two are experimental groups that employ digital content and the chatbot-based method. Preliminary findings indicate that employing chatbots can greatly enhance student learning experiences by allowing them to study at their own speed with less stress, saving them time, and keeping them motivated. Furthermore, integrating these AI systems into a smart classroom will not only create a supportive environment by encouraging good interactions with students, it will also allow learners to be more engaged and achieve better academic objectives.

AB Software architecture security design is a key stage in developing business-oriented system, such as business-critical system, ICT system and AI system. Many typical accidents also remind us that the security of software architecture even plays a more important role than the code security in most software systems. However, there are very few researches which focus on the security of software architecture. Especially, we don't find a systematic and feasible quantitative method to evaluate the security of software architecture. To fill this gap, we launched a research project focusing on software architecture security since 2019 and try to provide a series of quantitative methods for evaluating the security of software architecture. In this paper, a business-oriented quantitative method was proposed to evaluate the security of software architecture from the view of business-critical security insurance. In our method, both business dependency graph (BDG) and multi-hierarchical dependency graph (MHDG) are defined and constructed first for describing businesses and their relationships, and system components and their relationships; then, attack points and business key-points are identified and labeled on BDG and MHDG; and further, all potential attack paths and effective attack paths in the system based on MHDG are detected; and finally, a set of security indicators is defined and used to evaluate the security of software architecture quantitatively. For more effective experiments, we use software architectures with different styles and different evolution versions. Experimental results show that our method can reflect effectively the security characteristics of software architecture with different styles, can find the security changes of different architecture evolution versions for the same system, and can perform quantitative evaluation of software architecture security efficiently.

AB The number of citations is one of the main bibliometric indicators. However, not all citations can be considered equivalent; scite (https://scite.ai/), a new tool based on artificial intelligence, was developed to determine whether citations are positive, negative or neutral. We assessed whether publications first/last authored by women were more often cited positively (or negatively) than those first/last authored by men. Using the 2021 Journal Citation Reports (JCR) impact factor, we selected the ten highest impact journals in nine medical disciplines. Using Web of Science, we extracted all research and review articles published between January 2012 and December 2021 in these journals. We used Namsor to determine first/last authors' gender and scite to categorize article citations as positive ("supporting"), negative ("contradicting"), neutral ("mentioning") and "unclassified". There were 141,921 articles in the database, of which 116,204 had unabbreviated first/last names. We found that the proportion of positive and negative citations was higher for publications whose first/last authors were women (vs. men), while the opposite was true for neutral citations. This is the first study to our knowledge to document the association between gender and citation type. Further research is needed in the future to investigate the reasons for these gender differences, and to assess whether the type of citation is also associated with the gender of the citing author.

AB The research note discusses the potential effects of contemporary technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), in enhancing consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews in the tourism and hospitality context. The study postulates that three characteristics of blockchain - decentralization, immutability, and timestamping - ensure transparency in the online review process. Using a socio-technical systems approach, the current study provides insights into how blockchain technology, AI agents, and human factors interact to facilitate such transparency and thereby enhance consumers' trustworthiness of online reviews for their decision-making. Therefore, the study proposes that perceived transparency mediates the relationship between these three blockchain characteristics and the trustworthiness of online reviews. In proposing an investigation of the characteristics of blockchain and its interaction with AI in online reviews, the study highlights that researchers and practitioners pay attention to a specific characteristic of contemporary technologies to actualize potential benefits.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that involves the development of programs designed to replicate human cognitive processes and the analysis of complex data. In dermatology, which is predominantly a visual-based diagnostic field, AI has become increasingly important in improving professional processes, particularly in the diagnosis of psoriasis. In this review, we summarized current AI applications in psoriasis: (i) diagnosis, including identification, classification, lesion segmentation, lesion severity and area scoring; (ii) treatment, including prediction treatment efficiency and prediction candidate drugs; (iii) management, including e-health and preventive medicine. Key challenges and future aspects of AI in psoriasis were also discussed, in hope of providing potential directions for future studies.

AB This study aimed to verify the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots' gratitude expression for a fundraising campaign on recipients' willingness to donate. The mediating effects of self-efficacy and social worth on the relationship between expressions of gratitude and the willingness to donate were explored. The moderating effect of identity disclosure to enhance the effect of expressing gratitude was also investigated. By conducting a 2 (gratitude expression: absent vs. present) x 3(identity cue: text-only vs. robot vs. human) factorial design experiment with 564 American adults, the AI chatbot's gratitude expression was found to increase the subject's willingness to donate. The effect of these expressions of gratitude was mediated by self-efficacy rather than by social worth. However, when the AI chatbot provided a human identity cue, not only was the mediating effect of self-efficacy strengthened but the mediating effect of social worth was also significant.

AB Background Various versions of artificial intelligence (AI) have been used as a diagnostic tool aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer. One of the most important problems in breast screening progmrams is interval breast cancer (IBC).Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of Transpara v1.6 and v1.7 in the detection of IBC.Material and Methods Reports of screening mammograms of a total 2,248,665 of women were evaluated retrospectively. Of 2,129,486 mammograms reported as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 1 and 2, the IBC group consisted of 323 cases who were diagnosed as having cancer on mammography and were correlated with pathology in second mammogram taken >30 days after first mammogram. Four hundred and forty-one were defined as the control group because they did not change over 2 years. Cancer risk scores of both groups were determined from 1 to 10 with Tranpara v1.6 and v1.7. Diagnostic performances of both versions were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve.Results Cancer risk scores 1 and 10 in v1.7 increased compared to v1.6 (P < 0.001). In all cases, sensitivity for v1.6 was 56.6%, specificity was 90%, and, for v1.7, sensitivity was 65.9% and specificity was 90%, respectively. In all cases, area under the curve values were 0.812 for v1.6 and 0.856 for v1.7, which was higher in v1.7 (P < 0.001). Diagnostic performance of v1.7 was higher than v1.6 at the 7-12-month period (P < 0.001).Conclusion The present study showed that Tranpara v1.7 has a higher specificity, sensitivity and diagnostic performance in IBC determination than v1.6. AI systems can be used in breast screening as a secondary or third reader in screening programs.

AB Background and aimsIt is difficult to document atrial fibrillation (AF) on ECG in patients with non-persistent atrial fibrillation (non-PeAF). There is limited understanding of whether an AI prediction algorithm could predict the occurrence of non-PeAF from the information of normal sinus rhythm (SR) of a 12-lead ECG. This study aimed to derive a precise predictive AI model for screening non-PeAF using SR ECG within 4 weeks.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included patients aged 18 to 99 with SR ECG on 12-lead standard ECG (10 seconds) in Ewha Womans University Medical Center for 3 years. Data were preprocessed into three window periods (which are defined with the duration from SR to non-PeAF detection) - 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks from the AF detection prospectively. For experiments, we adopted a Residual Neural Network model based on 1D-CNN proposed in a previous study. We used 7,595 SR ECGs (extracted from 215,875 ECGs) with window periods of 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks for analysis.ResultsThe prediction algorithm showed an AUC of 0.862 and an F1-score of 0.84 in the 1:4 matched group of a 1-week window period. For the 1:4 matched group of a 2-week window period, it showed an AUC of 0.864 and an F1-score of 0.85. Finally, for the 1:4 matched group of a 4-week window period, it showed an AUC of 0.842 and an F1-score of 0.83.ConclusionThe AI prediction algorithm showed the possibility of risk stratification for early detection of non-PeAF. Moreover, this study showed that a short window period is also sufficient to detect non-PeAF.

AB Introduction: A pilot study assessing a novel approach to identify patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) using deep learning analysis of multi-site photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms ("DL-PPG").Methods: PPG recordings having baseline, unilateral arm pressure cuff occlusion and reactive hyperaemia flush phases from 6 body sites were studied in 51 Controls and 20 SSc patients. RGB scalogram images were obtained from the PPG, using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). 2 different pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs, namely, GoogLeNet and EfficientNetB0) were trained to classify the SSc and Control groups, evaluating their performance using 10-fold stratified cross validation (CV). Their classification performance (i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals) was also compared to traditional machine learning (ML), i.e., Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).Results: On a participant basis DL-PPG accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for GoogLeNet were 83.1 (72.3-90.9), 75.0 (50.9-91.3) and 86.3 (73.7-94.3)% respectively, and for EfficientNetB0 were 87.3 (77.2-94.0), 80.0 (56.3-94.3) and 90.1 (78.6-96.7)%. The corresponding results for ML classification using LDA were 66.2 (53.9-77.0), 65.0 (40.8-84.6) and 66.7 (52.1-79.2)% respectively, and for KNN were 76.1 (64.5-85.4), 40.0 (19.1-63.9), and 90.2 (78.6-96.7)% respectively.Discussion: This study shows the potential of DL-PPG classification using CNNs to detect SSc. EfficientNetB0 gave an overall improved performance compared to GoogLeNet, with both CNNs performing better than the traditional ML methods tested. Our automatic AI approach, using transfer learning, could offer significant benefits for SSc diagnostics in a variety of clinical settings where low-cost portable and easy-to-use diagnostics can be beneficial.

AB In this research paper, we investigated the viability of AI-supported translations of survey materials in intercultural and cross-cultural research, comparing the quality of machine translations to traditional human translations. Focusing on the HEXACO personality inventory, we translated the original English inventory using Google Translate and GPT-3.5 into 33 languages for which validated human translations exist. The statistical similarity between human- and machinegenerated translations varied considerably between the target languages. It was highest for target languages from the same language family as the source language, arguably because this relatedness allowed for more direct machine translations. Consistent with this reasoning, the genetic similarity between languages largely explained the differences observed. GPT's temperature setting determining how stringently or freely a text is translated had little influence on the similarity estimates, but very high levels tended to produce somewhat lower statistical similarity. To validate the quality of the machine translations, a group of social scientists rated the translation in a language for which the human and machine translations statistically converged strongly. Although the human translation was rated as being of higher quality than four out of five machine translations, these differences were relatively small. Crucially, the social scientists did not rate the human translation as significantly better than the GPT 3.5 translation with the lowest temperature setting. Based on these insights, we propose a framework outlining four recommendations for utilizing AI-supported translation in cross-cultural and intercultural research, involving AI to varying degrees in the forward-back translation process.

AB The destruction of millions of acres of forest each year by forest fires is a global environmental crisis that has realworld consequences for people's livelihoods and the health of our planet. The ability to foresee the onset of such a natural disaster is, thus, of paramount importance in reducing this risk. There have been numerous proposed technologies and novel approaches for detecting and preventing forest fires. Integrating AI to automate fire prediction and detection is becoming increasingly common. To provide effective forest fire detection, people make use of several technological expansions, with the IoT for data collecting and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the forecast process. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a key study technique that has been proven to be the best in enhancing the presentation of detecting fire threats in important locations by several researchers. Due to the importance of object detection in this investigation, EfficientDet was chosen for implementation. It is suggested that fire breakouts be detected using a Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (RLSTM-NN). Here, we propose a Cat Swarm Fractional Calculus Optimization (CSFCO) algorithm for deep learning that combines the best features of Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with fractional calculus for optimal training results (FC). Terms of the simulation results reveal that the suggested process outdoes the state-of-the-art approaches. The suggested typical can identify the onset of a fire with a precision of 98.6% and an error rate of only 0.14%.

AB The current work aims to design and provide a preliminary IND-enabling study of selective BMX inhibitors for cancer therapeutics development. BMX is an emerging target, more notably in oncological and immunological diseases. In this work, we have employed a predictive AI-based platform to design the selective inhibitors considering the novelty, IP prior protection, and drug-likeness properties. Furthermore, selected top candidates from the initial iteration of the design were synthesized and chemically characterized utilizing 1H NMR and LCMS. Employing a panel of biochemical (enzymatic) and cancer cell lines, the selected molecules were tested against these assays. In addition, we used artificial intelligence to predict and evaluate several critical INDfocused physicochemical and pharmacokinetics values of the selected molecules. A secondary objective of the current work was also to validate the sole role of BMX in animal models known to be mediated by BMX. More than 50 molecules were designed in the present study employing five novel discovered scaffolds. Two molecules were nominated for further IND-focused studies. Compound II showed promising in-vitro activity against BMX in both enzymatic assays compared to other kinases and in cancer cell lines with known BMX overexpression. Interestingly, compound II showed very favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetics properties as predicted by the used platforms. The animal study further confirmed the sole role of BMX in the disease model. The current work provides promising data on a selective BMX inhibitor as a potential lead for therapeutics development, and the asset is currently in the optimization stage. Notably, the current study shows a framework for a combined approach employing both AI and experimentation that can be used by academic labs in their research programs to more streamline programs into IND-focused to be bridged easily for further clinical development with industrial partners.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare plays a pivotal role in combating many fatal diseases, such as skin, breast, and lung cancer. AI is an advanced form of technology that uses mathematical-based algorithmic principles similar to those of the human mind for cognizing complex challenges of the healthcare unit. Cancer is a lethal disease with many etiologies, including numerous genetic and epigenetic mutations. Cancer being a multifactorial disease is difficult to be diagnosed at an early stage. Therefore, genetic variations and other leading factors could be identified in due time through AI and machine learning (ML). AI is the synergetic approach for mining the drug targets, their mechanism of action, and drug-organism interaction from massive raw data. This synergetic approach is also facing several challenges in data mining but computational algorithms from different scientific communities for multi-target drug discovery are highly helpful to overcome the bottlenecks in AI for drug-target discovery. AI and ML could be the epicenter in the medical world for the diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of almost any disease in the near future. In this comprehensive review, we explore the immense potential of AI and ML when integrated with the biological sciences, specifically in the context of cancer research. Our goal is to illuminate the many ways in which AI and ML are being applied to the study of cancer, from diagnosis to individualized treatment. We highlight the prospective role of AI in supporting oncologists and other medical professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes by examining the intersection of AI and cancer control. Although AI-based medical therapies show great potential, many challenges must be overcome before they can be implemented in clinical practice. We critically assess the current hurdles and provide insights into the future directions of AI-driven approaches, aiming to pave the way for enhanced cancer interventions and improved patient care.

AB Objective: To describe pure insular ictal semiology and patterns of extra-insular spread demonstrated by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) according to a classification based on the insular cytoarchitecture. Methods: We investigated the ictal semiology in 17 patients undergoing SEEG for insular epilepsy. The insular cortex was divided into three regions roughly overlapping with the agranular, dysgranular and granular regions. Ictal semiology was described accordingly: anterior insula (AI, short anterior and middle gyri), middle insula (MI, short posterior and long anterior gyri) and posterior insula (PI, long posterior gyrus). Results: Awareness impairment occurred secondarily to extra-insular ictal spread. Subjective manifestations were constant. AI seizures (n = 3) presented with autonomic (increased heart rate [HR], respiratory changes), oropharyngeal (mainly throat sensations), emotional (fear, anguish) semiology and the "handto-throat" sign followed by frontal-like semiology. MI seizures (n = 8) presented with mainly non-painful paresthesia, some autonomic (respiratory, increased HR), oropharyngeal or thermic symptoms and early motor features with spread to the opercular cortex. PI seizures (n = 6) were characterized by somatosensory semiology, mainly paresthesia potentially painful, and cephalic sensations. Conclusions: Cytoarchitectonic-based classification and the corresponding ictal features support the antero-posterior grading of insular seizures and highlight specific ictal symptoms. Significance: This refinement of insular semiology can help optimize the planning of SEEG for presumed insular epilepsy. CO 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB Introduction: MIRAGE syndrome is a rare disease characterized by myelodysplasia, infection, growth restriction, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy. Herein, we report the case of a girl with MIRAGE syndrome who presented with adrenal insufficiency and chronic diarrhea.Case presentation: The patient was born at 29 + 6 weeks of gestational age with a birth weight of 656 g (<3p). Her height and head circumference were also <3p. At birth, she presented with respiratory distress, meconium staining, and pneumomediastinum, which were managed with high-frequency ventilation and empirical antibiotics. Physical examination showed generalized hyperpigmentation and normal female genitalia. A few days after birth, polyuria and hypotension developed, and laboratory findings revealed hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were elevated with low serum cortisol levels and high plasma renin activity, which were suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were introduced and maintained, and hyperpigmentation attenuated with time. Both kidneys looked dysplastic, and adrenal glands could not be traced on abdominal ultrasound. From the early days of life, thrombocytopenia and anemia were detected, but not to life-threatening level and slowly recovered up to the normal range. Despite aggressive nutritional support, weight gain and growth spurt were severely retarded during the hospital stay. Additionally, after introducing enteral feeding, she experienced severe diarrhea and subsequent perineal skin rashes and ulcerations. Fecal calprotectin level was highly elevated; however, a small bowel biopsy resulted in non-specific submucosal congestion. The patient was diagnosed with MIRAGE syndrome with SAMD9 gene mutation. She was discharged with tube feeding and elemental formula feeding continued, but chronic diarrhea persisted. By the time of the last follow-up at 15 months of corrected age, she was fortunately not subjected to severe invasive infection and myelodysplastic syndrome. However, she was dependent on tube feeding and demonstrated a severe developmental delay equivalent to approximately 5-6 months of age.Conclusion: The early diagnosis of adrenal crisis and hormone replacement therapy can save the life of -patients with MIRAGE syndrome; however, chronic intractable diarrhea and growth and developmental delay continue to impede the patient's well-being.

   manufacturing; Electronics production
AB In the rapidly advancing fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, creating a robust and high-quality data foundation is a critical requirement for data-driven projects. However, the lack of a standard procedure for ensuring the existence of a sufficient and high-quality data basis often leads to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, and resource waste, resulting in a high risk of project failure. Existing methodologies often presuppose the availability of a data basis, which is a significant challenge, particularly in the manufacturing sector with its diverse and complex data sources. This challenge is further compounded by the interdisciplinary nature of these projects, where domain experts and data scientists with different expertise and vocabularies must collaborate. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces ML-SIPOC, a novel methodology for creating a standardized and high-quality data basis for data-driven projects. ML-SIPOC builds upon the traditional SIPOC analysis from the Six Sigma management system for operational excellence, adapted to meet the unique challenges of data-intensive projects. It provides a structured framework for systematically building a data foundation, facilitating effective communication between domain experts and data scientists. When applied in electronics manufacturing, ML-SIPOC proved efficient in creating a robust data basis, reducing time and cost overheads. This approach minimizes reliance on prior knowledge for data collection, opening up possibilities for broader AI and Big Data applications across various manufacturing sectors. The key innovation of this paper is the introduction of a first-of-its-kind methodology that provides a structured approach to building a data foundation for data-driven decision making in manufacturing.

AB This paper pioneers a novel exploration of environmental impacts in livestock farming, focusing on pig farming's intersection with climate change and sustainability. It emphasizes the transformative potential of data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies, specifically the Internet of Things (IoT) and multimodal data analysis, in promoting equitable and sustainable food systems. The study observes five pigs aged 86 to 108 days using a tripartite sensor that records heart rate, respiration rate, and accelerometer data. The unique experimental design alternates between periods of isolation during feeding and subsequent pairing, enabling the investigation of stress-induced changes. Key inquiries include discerning patterns in heart rate data during isolation versus paired settings, fluctuations in respiration rates, and behavioral shifts induced by isolation or pairing. The study also explores the potential detection of gait abnormalities, correlations between pigs' age and their gait or activity patterns, and the evolution of pigs' walking abilities with age. The paper scrutinizes accelerometer data to detect activity changes when pigs are paired, potentially indicating increased stress or aggression. It also examines the adaptation of pigs to alternating isolation and pairing over time and how their heart rate, respiration rate, and activity data reflect this process. The study considers other significant variables, such as time of day and isolation duration, affecting the pigs' physiological parameters. Sensor data are further utilized to identify behavioral patterns during periods of feeding, isolation, or pairing. In conclusion, this study harnesses IoT and multimodal data analysis in a groundbreaking approach to pig welfare research. It underscores the compelling potential of technology to inform about overall pig welfare, particularly stress levels and gait quality, and the power of data-driven insights in fostering equitable, healthy, and environmentally conscious livestock production systems.

AB In this study, we applied an optimal deep learning algorithm to detect defects in OLED cells. This study aims to enhance the yield of OLEDs by reducing the number of defective products through defect detection in OLED cells. Defects in OLED cells can arise owing to various factors, but dark spots are predominantly identified and studied. Therefore, actual dark spot images were required for this study. However, obtaining real data is challenging because of security concerns in the OLED industry. Therefore, a Solver program utilizing the finite element method (FEM) was employed to generate 2000 virtual dark spot images. The generated images were categorized into two groups: initial images of dark spots and images obtained after 10,000 h. The pixel values of these dark spot images were adjusted for efficient recognition and analysis. Furthermore, CNN, ResNet-50, and VGG-16 were implemented to apply the optimal deep learning algorithms. The results showed that the VGG-16 algorithm performed the best. A defect detection model was created based on the performance metrics of the deep learning algorithms. The model was trained using 1300 dark spot images and validated using 600 dark spot images. The validation results indicated an accuracy of 0.988 and a loss value of 0.026. A defect detection model that utilizes the VGG-16 algorithm was considered suitable for distinguishing dark spot images. To test the defect detection model, 100 images of dark spots were used. The experimental results indicated an accuracy of 89%. The images were classified as acceptable or defective based on the threshold values. By applying the VGG-16 deep learning algorithm to the defect detection model, we can enhance the yield of OLED products, reduce production costs, and contribute significantly to the advancement of OLED display manufacturing technology.

AB Depression disorder is a disease that causes a deterioration of daily function and can induce thoughts of suicide. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which is the official reference of the American Psychiatry Association and is also used in Korea to identify depressive disorders, sets nine criteria for diagnosing depressive disorders. The lack of counseling personnel, including psychiatrists, and negative social perceptions of depressive disorders prevent counselors from being treated for depressive disorders. Natural language processing-based artificial intelligence (AI) services such as chatbots can help fill this need, but labeled datasets are needed to train AI services. In this study we collected data from AI Hub wellness consultations and crawls of the Reddit website to augment and build word dictionaries and analyze morphemes using the Kind Korean Morpheme Analyzer and Word2Vec. The collected datasets were labeled based on word dictionaries built according to nine DSM-5 depressive disorder diagnostic criteria.

AB Over the last decades, the refinement of radiation therapy techniques has been associated with an increasing interest for individualized radiation therapy with the aim of increasing or maintaining tumor control and reducing radiation toxicity. Developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, in imaging sciences, including nuclear medecine, have led to significant enthusiasm for the concept of "rapid learning health system". AI combined with radiomics applied to (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ([18F1-FDG PET/CT) offers a unique opportunity for the development of predictive models that can help stratify each patient's risk and guide treatment decisions for optimal outcomes and quality of life of patients treated with radia-tion therapy. Here we present an overview of the current contribution of AI and radiomics-based machine learning models applied to (18F)-FDG PET/CT in the management of cancer treated by radiation therapy.(c) 2023 Societe franc,aise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).

AB Simple Summary Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neural-crest-derived tumors with variable prognosis. In an era of tailored treatment strategies, medical imaging plays a crucial role in the surgeries, image-guided procedures, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and radionuclide therapies involved in the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Medical imaging helps to confirm the diagnosis, guide surgical resection, assess metastatic staging, and select patients for specific therapies. In this step-by-step review, we perform a comprehensive analysis of recent imaging modalities developed for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas by covering their content and terminology as well as discussing the future implications of artificial intelligence.Abstract In this comprehensive review, we aimed to discuss the current state-of-the-art medical imaging for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) diagnosis and treatment. Despite major medical improvements, PPGLs, as with other neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), leave clinicians facing several challenges; their inherent particularities and their diagnosis and treatment pose several challenges for clinicians due to their inherent complexity, and they require management by multidisciplinary teams. The conventional concepts of medical imaging are currently undergoing a paradigm shift, thanks to developments in radiomic and metabolic imaging. However, despite active research, clinical relevance of these new parameters remains unclear, and further multicentric studies are needed in order to validate and increase widespread use and integration in clinical routine. Use of AI in PPGLs may detect changes in tumor phenotype that precede classical medical imaging biomarkers, such as shape, texture, and size. Since PPGLs are rare, slow-growing, and heterogeneous, multicentric collaboration will be necessary to have enough data in order to develop new PPGL biomarkers. In this nonsystematic review, our aim is to present an exhaustive pedagogical tool based on real-world cases, dedicated to physicians dealing with PPGLs, augmented by perspectives of artificial intelligence and big data.

AB The present study was conducted to investigate the potential of radiomics to develop an explainable AI-based system to be applied to ultra-widefield fundus retinographies (UWF-FRTs) with the objective of predicting the presence of the early signs of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and stratifying subjects with low- versus high-risk of AMD. The ultimate aim was to provide clinicians with an automatic classifier and a signature of objective quantitative image biomarkers of AMD. The use of Machine Learning (ML) and radiomics was based on intensity and texture analysis in the macular region, detected by a Deep Learning (DL)-based macular detector. Two-hundred and twenty six UWF-FRTs were retrospectively collected from two centres and manually annotated to train and test the algorithms. Notably, the combination of the ML-based radiomics model and the DL-based macular detector reported 93% sensitivity and 74% specificity when applied to the data of the centre used for external testing, capturing explainable features associated with drusen or pigmentary abnormalities. In comparison to the human operator's annotations, the system yielded a 0.79 Cohen & kappa;, demonstrating substantial concordance. To our knowledge, these results are the first provided by a radiomic approach for AMD supporting the suitability of an explainable feature extraction method combined with ML for UWF-FRT.

AB Collaborative software crowdsourcing (CSC) is now a vital part of the technological workforce due to the rising need for software solutions in an industry 5.0 smart city that exceeds performance standards without sacrificing cost-effectiveness. When a buyer intends to hire a group of productive workers within their budget limit and time frame, the CSC offers a potential solution for executing a software module in crowdsourcing. Existing literature works are limited by team-building mechanisms in CSC without considering reputation and technical competency, which are crucial to building an effective team. In this paper, we have developed an AI-based meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which gives personalized solutions for intelligent CSC team-building problems, namely PCS system, that effectively forms worker-teams. We furthermore develop a reputation-based scheme by considering workers' competency and prior performance to enhance the dependability and trustworthiness of the workers in the CSC platform by employing an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and the multi-step time balancing weight-based method. The developed PCS system also offers a utility function to buyers weighing the cost against task quality. All experiments are carried out in MATLAB and the results have shown that the developed PCS system enhances the buyer's quality-of-experience (QoE) and utility as high as 30% and 25%, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art works.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Although numerous radiologic parameters of abnormal hip joint morphology are utilized in practice, studies on the relation of these parameters to acetabular fractures are limited. This study hypothesized that certain morphological features of hip joints are associated with acetabular posterior wall (PW) fracture patterns and aimed to identify morphological characteristics predictive of acetabular PW fracture. The records of 107 consecutive patients, who were diagnosed with acetabular fractures in a level I trauma center from August 2017 to April 2021, were initially reviewed. After excluding patients who lacked proper radiographic evaluation and had previous surgery or concomitant injury on the ipsilateral lower limb, a total of 99 patients were analyzed to investigate the morphological characteristics of the hip joint, measured in computed tomography, associated with acetabular posterior wall fracture. We included patient demographics, acetabular index (AI), sharp angle, acetabular depth-to-width ratio (AD/WR), center-edge angle (CEA), head-neck offset ratio (HNOR), acetabular head index (AHI), anterior acetabular sector angle (AASA), posterior acetabular sector angle (PASA), and acetabular version angle (AVA) in the univariate and multivariate analyses. The injury mechanism (p = 0.001) and AD/WR (p = 0.021) were predictors of PW fracture in the univariate analysis. In the multivariable analysis, injury mechanism (p = 0.011), AI (coefficient B = 0.320; Exp (B) = 1.377; p = 0.017), and AD/WR (coefficient B = 33.047; Exp (B) = 2.250 x 1014; p = 0.028) were significant predictors of PW fracture. This study highlights the importance of morphological factors, such as a larger AI and AD/WR, that may influence joint stress distribution, resulting in acetabular PW fracture. Understanding these pathomechanisms may protect the hip joint and prevent future injuries through the early identification and treatment of pathological conditions.

ID PREDICTION
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting and sustainability are increasingly important for businesses around the world. Yet the lack of a single standardised method of measurement, when coupled with an inability to understand the true state of emissions in complex logistics activities, presents enormous barriers for businesses to understanding the extent of their emissions footprint. One of the traditional approaches to accurately capturing and monitoring gas emissions in logistics is through using gas sensors. However, connecting, maintaining, and operating gas sensors on moving vehicles in different road and weather conditions is a large and costly challenge. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a reliable and accurate sensing technique for GHG emissions collection (or monitoring) in real-time, employing the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to eliminate or reduce the usage of gas sensors, using reliable and cost-effective solutions.

AB Green AI (Artificial Intelligence) and digitalization facilitate the "Dual-Carbon" goal of low-carbon, high-quality economic development. Green AI is moving from "cloud" to "edge" devices like TinyML, which supports devices from cameras to wearables, offering low-power IoT computing. This study attempts to provide a conceptual update of climate and environmental policy in open synergy with proprietary and open-source TinyML technology, and to provide an industry collaborative and policy perspective on the issue, through using differential game models. The results show that patent and open source, as two types of TinyML innovation, can benefit a wide range of low-carbon industries and climate policy coordination. From the case of TinyML, we find that collaboration and sharing can lead to the implementation of green AI, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, and helping to fight climate change and protect the environment.

AB Due to global ecological restrictions, cities, particularly urban transportation, must choose ecological solutions. Sustainable bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an important element in the worldwide transportation infrastructure as an alternative to fossil-fuel-powered cars in metropolitan areas. Nevertheless, the placement of docks, which are the parking areas for bikes, depends on accessibility to bike paths, population density, difficulty in bike mobility, commuting cost, the spread of docks, and route imbalance. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of various time series and machine learning algorithms for predicting bike demand using a two-year historical log from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington, DC, USA. Specifically, the algorithms tested are LSTM, GRU, RF, ARIMA, and SARIMA, and their performance is then measured using the MSE, MAE, and RMSE metrics. The study found GRU performed the best, with RF also producing reasonably accurate predictions. ARIMA and SARIMA models produced less accurate predictions, likely due to their assumptions of linearity and stationarity in the data. In summary, this research offers significant insights into the efficacy of diverse algorithms in forecasting bike demand, thereby contributing to future research in the field.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), as a rapidly developing and powerful tool to solve practical problems, has attracted much attention and has been widely used in various areas. Owing to their strong learning and accurate prediction abilities, all sorts of AI models have also been applied in wastewater treatment (WWT) to optimize the process, predict the efficiency and evaluate the performance, so as to explore more cost-effective solutions to WWT. In this review, we summarize and analyze various AI models and their applications in WWT. Specifically, we briefly introduce the commonly used AI models and their purposes, advantages and disadvantages, and comprehensively review the inputs, outputs, objectives and major findings of particular AI applications in water quality monitoring, laboratory-scale research and process design. Although AI models have gained great success in WWT-related fields, there are some challenges and limitations that hinder the widespread applications of AI models in real WWT, such as low interpretability, poor model reproducibility and big data demand, as well as a lack of physical significance, mechanism explanation, academic transparency and fair comparison. To overcome these hurdles and successfully apply AI models in WWT, we make recommendations and discuss the future directions of AI applications.

AB STUDY QUESTION: Do embryologists from different European countries agree on embryo disposition decisions ('use' or 'discard') about Day 7 (>144 h post-insemination) and/or low-quality blastocysts (LQB; <Gardner's BB) (i.e. borderline quality blastocysts)?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: The prevalence of 'discard' answers was 38.7%; nevertheless, embryologists' agreement was overall just fair (Fleiss-k = 0.26).
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The utilization of LQBs and adoption of culture beyond 144 h post-insemination is increasing worldwide. Although morphology and morphokinetics are associated with embryo developmental competence, previous studies demonstrated significant interobserver variability among embryologists regarding embryo quality assessment and disposition decisions for borderline quality blastocysts.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: An anonymous survey was run in a large network of IVF centers. A total of 117 embryologists from 6 European countries and 29 IVF centers filled in the survey. Randomly selected anonymous time-lapse videos of 50 Day 7 and/or LQB whole embryo preimplantation development were assessed by the embryologists. The key information on patients/cycles was provided along with each video. All cycles entailed preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies. Each embryologist specified whether he/she would have discarded or used ('transfer-fresh'/'cryopreserve'/'biopsy') any embryo. Inter-rater agreement was measured with Fleiss-k.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Examiners were asked about their years of experience, center location, average number of cycles and average maternal age, number of colleagues, and use of time-lapse incubators at their centers. All participants were blinded to artificial intelligence (AI) scores generated by two commercially available software packages, chromosomal diagnosis (all blastocysts were tested for aneuploidies), and clinical outcomes after vitrified-warmed euploid single blastocyst transfer. These data were known only by one embryologist not involved in the survey.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Participants were Italian (40%, N = 47), Spanish (24%, N = 28), Portuguese (5%, N = 6), Czech (5%, N = 6), Swedish (23%, N = 27), and Icelandic (3%, N = 3). In total, 2263 (38.7%) 'discard' and 3587 (61.3%) 'use' decisions were recorded. Czech, Portuguese, and Italian embryologists expressed lower 'discard' decision rates (mean +/- SD 17 +/- 7%, range 8-24%; 23 +/- 14% range 4-46%; and 27 +/- 18% range 2-72%, respectively), while Spanish gave intermediate (37 +/- 16% range 4-66%) and Nordic gave higher (67 +/- 11% range 40-90%) rates. The prevalence of 'discard' answers was 38.7% out of 5850 choices (mean per embryologist: 39 +/- 23% range 2-90%). Only embryologists' country and IVF group were associated with this rate. Overall agreement among embryologists was fair (Fleiss-k = 0.26). The prevalence of 'discard' responses per embryo was 37 +/- 24% (range 2-87%). Only the number of sibling blastocysts influenced this rate (i.e. the larger the cohort, the higher the inclination to 'discard'). No difference was shown for the two scores between euploid and aneuploid borderline quality blastocysts, while the embryologists were, by chance, more prone to 'discard' the latter (28.3 +/- 21% range 9-71% versus 41.6 +/- 24.8% range 2-87%, respectively).
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The survey included only private IVF clinics located in Europe. Moreover, a key variable is missing, namely patients' access to care. Indeed, all embryologists involved in the survey were part of the same network of private IVF clinics, while the embryo disposition decisions might be different in a public setting.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Decision-making by European embryologists regarding Day 7 embryos or LQBs is inconsistent with putative clinical consequences, especially in patients with low prognosis. Although the embryologists could make decisions independent from their local regulations, their mindset and clinical background influenced their choices. In the future, AI tools should be trained to assess borderline quality embryos and empowered with cost-effectiveness information to support embryologists' decisions with more objective assessments.

AB Background Ninety-watt applications are more sensitive to catheter instability and produce lesions that are shallower and smaller in diameter than 50-W applications. These characteristics were considered for the development of a combined (90-50 W) pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) strategy which was prospectively compared to a 50 W-only ablation index (AI)-guided PVI strategy.
   Methods One hundred fifty consecutive paroxysmal AF patients underwent PVI under general anesthesia using CARTO. In the first 75 patients, PVI was performed with a combined (90-50 W) strategy using the QDOT-MICRO catheter in a temperature-controlled mode. This strategy consisted of 90 W-4 s applications on the posterior LA wall (at sites of catheter stability and expectedly thin atrial tissue) with an interlesion distance (ILD) <= 4 mm and 50-W applications elsewhere (at sites of catheter instability or expectedly thick atrial tissue) with ILD < 6 mm. In the subsequent 75 patients, PVI was performed with a 50 W-only AI-guided strategy using the SmartTouch-SF catheter in a power-controlled mode.
   Results Both groups of patients had similar clinical characteristics and LA dimensions (123.1 +/- 24.9 ml vs 119 +/- 26.8 ml, P = 0.33). Total procedural times (61 [56-70] vs 65 [60-75] min, P = 0.12), first-pass PVI (82.6 vs 80%, P = 0.81), acute PV reconnection (0 vs 6.6%, P = 0.05), and 1-year SR maintenance (93.3 vs 90.6%, P = 0.57) rates were also similar in both groups of patients. There were no complications in the combined (90-50 W) group while only 2 groin hematomas were reported in the 50 W group.
   Conclusions In paroxysmal AF patients, a combined (90-50 W) strategy for PVI did not improve safety, efficiency, or effectiveness compared to a 50 W-only AI-guided strategy.

AB Objectives The current research on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation sites at different positions of the FAM83H gene and their phenotypic changes leading to amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is inconsistent. We identified a previously reported heterozygous nonsense mutation c.1192C>T (p.Q398*) in the FAM83H gene and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dental ultrastructure and chemical composition changes induced by this mutation. Additionally, we predicted the protein feature affected by this mutation site. The aim was to further deepen our understanding of the diversity of AI caused by different mutation sites in the FAM83H gene.Methods Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm the mutation sites. Physical features of the patient's teeth were investigated using various methods including cone beam computer tomography (CBCT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact profilometry (roughness measurement), and a nanomechanical tester (nanoindentation measurement). The protein features of wild-type and mutant FAM83H were predicted using bioinformatics methods.Results One previously discovered FAM83H heterozygous nonsense mutation c.1192C>T (p.Q398*) was detected in the patient. SEM revealed inconsistent dentinal tubules, and EDS showed that calcium and phosphorus were lower in the patient's dentin but higher in the enamel compared to the control tooth. Roughness measurements showed that AI patients' teeth had rougher occlusal surfaces than those of the control tooth. Nanoindentation measurements showed that the enamel and dentin hardness values of the AI patients' teeth were both significantly reduced compared to those of the control tooth. Compared to the wild-type FAM83H protein, the mutant FAM83H protein shows alterations in stability, hydrophobicity, secondary structure, and tertiary structure. These changes could underlie functional differences and AI phenotype variations caused by this mutation site.Conclusions This study expands the understanding of the effects of FAM83H mutations on tooth structure.Clinical relevanceOur study enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of AI and may contribute to improved diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies for patients with FAM83H-related AI.

AB Genetics and omics studies of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia subtypes enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms and pathways that can be targeted. We identified key remaining challenges: First, can we enhance genetic studies to address missing heritability? Can we identify reproducible omics signatures that differentiate between dementia subtypes? Can high-dimensional omics data identify improved biomarkers? How can genetics inform our understanding of causal status of dementia risk factors? And which biological processes are altered by dementia-related genetic variation? Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches give us powerful new tools in helping us to tackle these challenges, and we review possible solutions and examples of best practice. However, their limitations also need to be considered, as well as the need for coordinated multidisciplinary research and diverse deeply phenotyped cohorts. Ultimately AI approaches improve our ability to interrogate genetics and omics data for precision dementia medicine. HighlightsWe have identified five key challenges in dementia genetics and omics studies.AI can enable detection of undiscovered patterns in dementia genetics and omics data.Enhanced and more diverse genetics and omics datasets are still needed.Multidisciplinary collaborative efforts using AI can boost dementia research.

TI Age-related bias and artificial intelligence: a scoping review
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS

DT Review
ID RECOGNITION; GENDER; DEMOGRAPHICS; NEED
AB There are widespread concerns about bias and discriminatory output related to artificial intelligence (AI), which may propagate social biases and disparities. Digital ageism refers to ageism reflected design, development, and implementation of AI systems and technologies and its resultant data. Currently, the prevalence of digital ageism and the sources of AI bias are unknown. A scoping review informed by the Arksey and O'Malley methodology was undertaken to explore age-related bias in AI systems, identify how AI systems encode, produce, or reinforce age-related bias, what is known about digital ageism, and the social, ethical and legal implications of age-related bias. A comprehensive search strategy that included five electronic bases and grey literature sources including legal sources was conducted. A framework of machine learning biases spanning from data to user by Mehrabi et al. is used to present the findings (Mehrabi et al. 2021). The academic search resulted in 7595 articles that were screened according to the inclusion criteria, of which 307 were included for full-text screening, and 49 were included in this review. The grey literature search resulted in 2639 documents screened, of which 235 were included for full text screening, and 25 were found to be relevant to the research questions pertaining to age and AI. As a result, a total of 74 documents were included in this review. The results show that the most common AI applications that intersected with age were age recognition and facial recognition systems. The most frequent machine learning algorithms used were convolutional neural networks and support vector machines. Bias was most frequently introduced in the early 'data to algorithm' phase in machine learning and the 'algorithm to user' phase specifically with representation bias (n = 33) and evaluation bias (n = 29), respectively (Mehrabi et al. 2021). The review concludes with a discussion of the ethical implications for the field of AI and recommendations for future research.

AB Environmental pollution has become a significant concern of nations. International organizations, local authorities, and social activists try to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) to protect the environment. However, this cannot be achieved without acknowledging the role of advanced technology applications. Previous studies found a significant relationship between technology and energy resources. But the need to highlight the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) in dealing with inevitable environmental issues still requires more attention. This study aims to analyze the application of AI applications in predicting, developing, and implementing wind and solar energy resources through a bibliometric analysis from 1991 to 2022. It uses bilioshiny of the "bibliometrix 3.0" package of R-programming for influential core aspects and keyword analysis and VOSviewer for co-occurrence analysis. The study provides significant implications for core authors, documents, sources, affiliations, and countries. It also provides keyword analysis and a co-occurrence network to cope with the conceptual integration of the literature. It reports three significant streams of literature in clusters: AI optimization and renewable energy resources; smart renewable energy resource challenges and opportunities; deep learning and machine learning forecasting; and energy efficiency. The findings will uncover the strategic perspective of AI technology for wind and solar energy generation projects.

AB The last wave of AI developments sparked a global surge in computing resources allocated to neural network models. Even though such models solve complex problems, their mathematical foundations are simple, with the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation standing out as one of the most important. However, improvements in traditional CMOS technologies fail to match the ever-increasing performance requirements of AI applications, therefore new technologies, as well as disruptive computing architectures must be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel in-memory implementation of a MAC operator based on stochastic computing and optical phase-change memories (oPCMs), leveraging their proven non-volatility and multilevel capabilities to achieve convolution. We show that resorting to the stochastic computing paradigm allows one to exploit the dynamic mechanisms of oPCMs to naturally compute and store MAC results with less noise sensitivity. Under similar conditions, we demonstrate an improvement of up to 64x and 10x in the applications that we evaluated.

AB In the present era, data plays a crucial role across various disciplines, serving as the foundation for exploration and advancements. However, in the domain of eHealth, a readily available dataset for training AI models to predict cardiac arrest using the internet of medical things (IoMT) is lacking. To bridge this gap, this research article addresses the need for a synthesized dataset that can be utilized by researchers in the eHealth field to evaluate the effectiveness of their AI/ML models. The article presents a synthesized IoMT dataset specifically designed for cardiac arrest prediction, incorporating valid ranges of IoMT-based medical features sourced from peer-reviewed journals and articles. This study offers the capability to generate synthetic datasets of varying sizes, catering to the specific requirements of researchers focused on cardiac arrest prediction for individual subjects (patients). The availability of such a dataset will contribute to the advancement of AI-driven research in the eHealth domain.

AB AI-based IoT applications relying on heavy-load deep learning algorithms like CNNs challenge IoT devices that are restricted in energy or processing capabilities. Edge computing offers an alternative by allowing the data to get offloaded to so-called edge servers with hardware more powerful than IoT devices and physically closer than the cloud. However, the increasing complexity of data and algorithms and diverse conditions make even powerful devices, such as those equipped with FPGAs, insufficient to cope with the current demands. In this case, optimizations in the algorithms, like pruning and early-exit, are mandatory to reduce the CNNs computational burden and speed up inference processing. With that in mind, we propose ExpOL, which combines the pruning and early-exit CNN optimizations in a system-level FPGA-based IoT-Edge design space exploration. Based on a user-defined multi-target optimization, ExpOL delivers designs tailored to specific application environments and user needs. When evaluated against state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators (either local or offloaded), designs produced by ExpOL are more power-efficient (by up to 2x) and process inferences at higher user quality of experience (by up to 12.5%).

AB PurposeArtificial Intelligence (AI) imitating human-like language, such as ChatGPT, has impacted lives throughout various multidisciplinary fields. However, despite these innovations, it is unclear how well its implementation will assist patients in clinical situations. We evaluated changes in patient perceptions regarding AI before and after reading a ChatGPT-written explanation.Materials and methodsIn total, 24 South Korean patients receiving urolithiasis treatment were surveyed through questionnaires. The ChatGPT explanatory note was provided between the first and second questionnaires, detailing lifestyle modifications for preventing urolithiasis recurrence. The study questionnaire was the Korean version of the General Attitudes toward Artificial Intelligence Scale, including positive and negative attitude items. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were accomplished to compare questionnaire scores before and after receiving the explanatory note. A linear regression analysis with stepwise elimination was used to assess variable (demographic data) accuracy in predicting outcomes.ResultsThere were significant differences between total negative questionnaire scores pre- and post-surveys of ChatGPT, but not in the positive scores. Among variables, only education level significantly influenced mean score differences in the negative questionnaires.ConclusionsThe negative perception change among urolithiasis patients after receiving the explanatory note provided by the AI chatbot program was observed, evidencing that patients with lower education levels expressed a more negative response. The explanatory note provided by the AI chatbot program could provoke an adverse change in AI perception. Negative human responses must be considered to improve and adapt new technology in health care. Only through changing patient perspectives will upgraded AI technology integrate into medical healthcare.

AB 6G networks can support global, ubiquitous and seamless connectivity through the convergence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Unlike terrestrial scenarios, NTNs pose unique challenges including propagation characteristics, latency and mobility, owing to the operations in spaceborne and airborne platforms. To overcome all these technical hurdles, this survey paper presents the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in learning and adapting to the complex NTN environments. We begin by providing an overview of NTNs in the context of 6G, highlighting the potential security and privacy issues. Next, we review the existing AI methods adopted for 6G NTN optimization, starting from machine learning (ML), through deep learning (DL) to deep reinforcement learning (DRL). All these AI techniques have paved the way towards more intelligent network planning, resource allocation (RA), and interference management. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in AI-powered NTN for 6G networks. Finally, we conclude by providing insights and recommendations on the key enabling technologies for future AI-powered 6G NTNs.

AB Looking for available parking slots has become a serious issue in urban mobility, since it influences traffic and emissions. This paper presents a set of metrics and techniques to predict the number of available parking slots in off-street parking facilities. This study deals with deep learning model solutions according with a mid-term prediction of 24 hours, every 15 minutes. Such a mid-term prediction can be useful for citizens who need to plan a car transfer well in advance and to reduce as much as possible any computational effort. Since most solutions in literature are focused on 1-hour ahead prediction, the proposed solution has been also tested in these conditions. The proposed solution is based on Convolutional Bidirectional LSTM models. Results have been compared in terms of precision metrics based both on occupancy and free slots. The paper also provides a framework to pass from an assessment model based on occupancy to models based on free slots and vice-versa. The obtained results have improved those already available in literature. A formal study has been conducted to perform feature relevance analysis by using explainable AI technique based on gradient and integrated gradient and proposing new heatmaps which highlighted the difference from LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM, feature relevance (base line, weather, traffic, etc.) and the impact of seasonality on predictions, namely the temporal relevance of features. The comparison has been performed on the basis of data collected in garages in the area of Florence, Tuscany, Italy by using Snap4city platform and infrastructure.

AB Seismic inversion can be used to invert the subsurface acoustic impedance leveraging migrated seismic section, which can help lithology interpretation. It is not easy to predict impedance directly from poststack seismic data. In the field data, the interference of random noise aggravates the difficulty of impedance inversion. Previous work mainly focused on trace-by-trace strategy leading to poor lateral continuity. We propose a 2-D temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based poststack seismic low-frequency extrapolation and a TCN-based impedance prediction method. We use a two-step workflow for acoustic impedance prediction from poststack seismic data. First, we use a neural network (low-frequency extrapolation network, LE-Net) for the low-frequency extrapolation of seismic data, and then we use another neural network (acoustic impedance network, AI-Net) to predict acoustic impedance. The input to LE-Net is high-frequency band-limited seismic and low-frequency impedance data. Seismic data after low-frequency extrapolation and low-frequency impedance are used to predict impedance. Two-dimensional TCN and multitrace input data can introduce spatial information from surrounding traces. The output of the network is single-trace data. The proposed network can ensure the single-trace prediction accuracy and improve lateral continuity. Numerical experimental results show that our proposed two-step workflow, named AI-LE, performs well on Marmousi II and has a certain generalization on the SEAM model. The results on field data show that AI-Net can predict relatively accurate impedance. The low-frequency extrapolation of seismic data can help improve the performance of impedance prediction.

AB Nowadays, lithium-ion (Li-ion) is among the most used chemistry for batteries and shows an increasing market growth rate; however, to reduce failure or safety risks, the battery state-of-charge (SoC) must be accurately monitored and predicted by a suitable battery management system (BMS). Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been extensively applied to this field with good results. Typically, AIs are trained on dynamic profile data, emulating battery charging and discharging cycles related to the application under test. In this article, a novel approach is presented: application-independent constant current profiles are used to train a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. To enhance the estimation accuracy, the output of the obtained SVR model was postprocessed. Finally, an error correction algorithm was applied to further reduce the estimation error. The system is validated over test cycles, representing different application scenarios for the battery cell operations. For the development of the proposed approach, a total of 105 constant current discharge profiles for the training and 20 realistic test cycles for the validation have been considered, including standard automotive cycles and a generic battery-powered power tool. The performance in the SoC estimation resulted in a root-meansquare error (RMSE) of 0.94% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.75% over all the test cycles. Error metrics are comparable to those obtained for SoC estimation AI algorithms based on traditional approaches using application-dependent battery profiles for the training phase.

AB This paper overcomes the security and privacy issues of the Internet of military vehicles (IoMVs), wherein the attackers intercept and manipulate the IoMV communication to disrupt military operations. Moreover, IoMV communication uses the public Internet to route their sensitive data, which is open to several network-related attacks, such as data injection, session hijacking, privilege escalation, etc. To overcome the aforesaid security and privacy concerns, we proposed a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted onion routing framework to strengthen the security and anonymity of IoMVs participating in military operations. AI algorithms are amended to classify the malicious and non-malicious IoMVs so that only non-malicious IoMVs can participate in the data exchange via the onion routing network. In addition, each IoMV is uniquely identified by two identifiers, i.e., tag and verifying token, which is stored in the block of a blockchain. These identifiers authenticate and validate the participating IoMVs. Based on that, non-malicious IoMVs can participate in the onion routing network to securely transmit sensitive data. Further, each entity of the proposed frame-work utilized the indispensable characteristics of a 6G network to minimize the data loss and validated using the packet drop ratio parameter. Lastly, the proposed framework is evaluated using different evaluation metrics, such as statistical measures and blockchain processing time.

AB Vision is the most critical sense helping us to understand the world around us. Ophthalmology is an area of medicine that deals with the eye and vision. In many remote areas, people do not have access to ophthalmologists, and many go blind for preventable reasons. Awareness about eye health and early diagnosis is essential in eye health to prevent blindness. An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can quickly detect eye disease is valuable and necessary. Anterior segment eye images are essential and easily obtained without additional equipment. In this study, I aimed to build an artificial intelligence algorithm to detect eye diseases from mobile photographs. I extracted and combined anterior segment eye photos from various publicly available datasets and labeled 3938 images as Normal (healthy) and 1094 images as Abnormal (unhealthy). I increased the data diversity by augmenting it with random flips and rotations: and then prepared it for AI training. I re-trained the algorithms trained in ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge with the transfer learning method. I compared custom and pre-trained models. After evaluating the performance of the models with the test set, 98% accuracy and 97% F1 score were obtained with the Inception-ResNetV2 model.

AB A key element of autonomous vehicles is lane-keeping. To keep an automobile in its lane, numerous artificial intelligence technologies and vision systems are employed. Despite being widely used, current systems function effectively in favorable weather. Downstream computer vision models may perform worse due to rain and other weather-related obstacles. For this reason, rain, snow, and mist noise must be detected, recognized, and removed by vision systems to improve system performance. For these issues, the autoencoder neural network is particularly common. The main goal of using an autoencoder for image deraining is to maintain originality because autoencoders adhere to the backpropagation procedure instead of the traditional techniques, which results in the signal coming out being ultimately the altered version of the input signal. This study covers a method for reducing the amount of rain in photos utilizing image processing, deep learning methods with autoencoder implementation, and end-to-end learning to determine the best steering rotation setting for retaining a vehicle in its lane using a donkey car. After training, the end-to-end model may be able to directly guide the car using the information from the front view camera, unlike the conventional method which manually breaks down the autonomous driving issue into specific details. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model takes raw images as input and generates the proper steering angles. The AI Kit Donkey Car is used in this study to collect data, train models, and evaluate them. According to the experimental results, the combination of the deraining method and end-to-end deep learning produces good performance in rainy situations.

AB We present IPU Trusted Extensions (ITX), a set of hardware extensions that enables trusted execution environments in Graphcore's AI accelerators. ITX enables the execution of AI workloads with strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees at low performance overheads. ITX isolates workloads from untrusted hosts, and ensures their data and models remain encrypted at all times except within the accelerator's chip. ITX includes a hardware root-of-trust that provides attestation capabilities and orchestrates trusted execution, and on-chip programmable cryptographic engines for authenticated encryption of code/data at PCIe bandwidth.
   We also present software for ITX in the form of compiler and runtime extensions that support multi-party training without requiring a CPU-based TEE.
   We included experimental support for ITX in Graphcore's GC200 IPU taped out at TSMC's 7nm node. Its evaluation on a development board using standard DNN training workloads suggests that ITX adds < 5% performance overhead and delivers up to 17x better performance compared to CPU-based confidential computing systems based on AMD SEV-SNP.

AB As more apps embrace AI, it is becoming increasingly common that multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNN)-powered apps may run at the same time on a mobile device. This paper explores scheduling in such multi-instance DNN scenarios, on general open mobile systems (e.g., common smartphones and tablets). Unlike closed systems (e.g., autonomous driving systems) where the set of co-run apps are known beforehand, the user of an open mobile system may install or uninstall arbitrary apps at any time, and a centralized solution is subject to adoption barriers. This work proposes the first-known decentralized application-level scheduling mechanism to address the problem. By leveraging the adaptivity of Deep Reinforcement Learning, the solution is shown to make the scheduling of co-run apps converge to a Nash equilibrium point, yielding a good balance of gains among the apps. The solution moreover automatically adapts to the running environment and the underlying OS and hardware. Experiments show that the solution consistently produces significant speedups and energy savings across DNN workloads, hardware configurations, and running scenarios.

AB Many people who are blind take and post photos to share about their lives and connect with others. Yet, current technology does not provide blind people with accessible ways to handle when private information is unintentionally captured in their images. To explore the technology design in supporting them with this task, we developed a design probe for blind people-ImageAlly- that employs a human-AI hybrid approach to detect and redact private image content. ImageAlly notifies users when potential private information is detected in their images, using computer vision, and enables them to transfer those images to trusted sighted allies to edit the private content. In an exploratory study with pairs of blind participants and their sighted allies, we found that blind people felt empowered by ImageAlly to prevent privacy leakage in sharing images on social media. They also found other benefits from using ImageAlly, such as potentially improving their relationship with allies and giving allies the awareness of the accessibility challenges they face.

AB The public has many concerns and fears regarding artificial intelligence (AI). Some are general or existential, while others are more specific with personal repercussions, like weakened human relationships, job loss, and further erosion of privacy. In this work, we provide a deeper understanding of how AI privacy concerns are taking shape. We surveyed public opinion of AI's expected effects on privacy with 10,011 respondents spanning ten countries and six continents. We identify four main themes regarding how the public believes AI impacts privacy: vulnerability of data, highly personal data and inference, lack of consent, and surveillance and government use. Unlike many aspects of AI and algorithmic literacy, for which public perception is often reported to be riddled with inconsistency and misconceptions, these privacy concerns are well-reasoned and broadly aligned with expert narratives. Based on our findings, we provide a roadmap of public priorities to help guide researchers and the broader community in exploring solutions that ameliorate AI's impact on privacy, and to inform efforts related to civic participation.

AB The prosperity of AI and edge computing has pushed more and more well-trained DNN models to be deployed on third-party edge devices to compose mission-critical applications. This necessitates protecting model confidentiality at untrusted devices, and using a co-located accelerator (e.g., GPU) to speed up model inference locally. Recently, the community has sought to improve the security with CPU trusted execution environments (TEE). However, existing solutions either run an entire model in TEE, suffering from extremely high inference latency, or take a partition-based approach to handcraft partial model via parameter obfuscation techniques to run on an untrusted GPU, achieving lower inference latency at the expense of both the integrity of partitioned computations outside TEE and accuracy of obfuscated parameters.
   We propose SOTER, the first system that can achieve model confidentiality, integrity, low inference latency and high accuracy in the partition-based approach. Our key observation is that there is often an associativity property among many inference operators in DNN models. Therefore, SOTER automatically transforms a major fraction of associative operators into parameter-morphed, thus confidentiality-preserved operators to execute on untrusted GPU, and fully restores the execution results to accurate results with associativity in TEE. Based on these steps, SOTER further designs an oblivious fingerprinting technique to safely detect integrity breaches of morphed operators outside TEE to ensure correct executions of inferences. Experimental results on six prevalent models in the three most popular categories show that, even with stronger model protection, SOTER achieves comparable performance with partition-based baselines while retaining the same high accuracy as insecure inference.

DE differential privacy; federated meta-learning; adaptive clipping;
   privacy utility trade-off
AB Federated meta-learning has emerged as a promising AI framework for today's mobile computing scenes involving distributed clients. It enables collaborative model training using the data located at distributed mobile clients and accommodates clients that need fast model customization with limited new data. However, federated meta-learning solutions are susceptible to inference-based privacy attacks since the global model encoded with clients' training data is open to all clients and the central server. Meanwhile, differential privacy (DP) has been widely used as a countermeasure against privacy inference attacks in federated learning. The adoption of DP in federated meta-learning is complicated by the model accuracy-privacy trade-off and the model hierarchy attributed to the meta-learning component. In this paper, we introduce DP-FedMeta, a new differentially private federated meta-learning architecture that addresses such data privacy challenges. DP-FedMeta features an adaptive gradient clipping method and a one-pass meta-training process to improve the model utility-privacy trade-off. At the core of DPFedMeta are two DP mechanisms, namely DP-AGR and DP-AGRLR, to provide two notions of privacy protection for the hierarchical models. Extensive experiments in an emulated federated metalearning scenario on well-known datasets (Omniglot, CIFAR-FS, and Mini-ImageNet) demonstrate that DP-FedMeta accomplishes better privacy protection while maintaining comparable model accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art solution that directly applies DP-based meta-learning to the federated setting.

AB This paper contributes to the literature around the Kaldor-Verdoorn law and analyses the impact of robotisation on the channels through which the law shapes labour-productivity growth. We start with a simple evolutionary reinterpretation of the law that combines Kaldorian and neo-Schumpeterian arguments. We then apply a GMM estimator to a panel of 17 industries in 25 OECD capitalist economies for the period 1990-2018. After elaborating on the general evidence of the evolutionary interpretation of the law, the estimates suggest a positive influence from robotisation: a higher robot density strengthens both the channel that ties labour productivity dynamics with mechanisation, and the one connected with the general advancement of science and technology which joins productivity to aggregate demand. This overall result is robust to several specifications of the underlying econometric model. Moreover, we find some evidence of technological unemployment out of the macroeconomic factor. Results agree with the empirical literature that suggests different impacts from robotisation on the basis of the level of economic activity considered.

AB Object detection studies aim to solve safety problems at industrial sites; however, improving object detection performance and ensuring real-time capabilities simultaneously remains challenging in multi-complex industrial environments. This paper proposes an unconditionally protected detector to address this problem. The detector's backbone network uses a residual block with a bottleneck structure to reduce computation and enhance real-time performance. Additionally, a selective attention network enhances object detection by extracting important features based on the morphological characteristics of the feature map in the neck structure. The method includes a whole-body estimation to locate individuals obstructed by obstacles, thereby preventing collisions with vehicles and avoiding hazardous situations in restricted areas. The proposed method enables real-time object detection and risk assessment for nearby objects, enhancing safety for industrial vehicle drivers and workers. Moreover, it can lead to further improvements in object detection performance in research fields such as autonomous driving and AI CCTV utilizing cameras.

AB Accumulating evidence from retrospective studies demonstrate at least non-inferior performance when using AI algorithms with different strategies versus double-reading in mammography screening. In addition, AI algorithms for mammography screening can reduce work load by moving to single human reading. Prospective trials are essential to avoid unintended adverse consequences before incorporation of AI algorithms into UK's National Health Service (NHS) Breast Screening Programme (BSP). A stakeholders' meeting was organized in Newnham College, Cambridge, UK to undertake a review of the current evidence to enable consensus discussion on next steps required before implementation into a screening programme. It was concluded that a multicentre multivendor testing platform study with opt-out consent is preferred. AI thresholds from different vendors should be determined while maintaining non-inferior screening performance results, particularly ensuring recall rates are not increased. Automatic recall of cases using an agreed high sensitivity AI score versus automatic rule out with a low AI score set at a high sensitivity could be used. A human reader should still be involved in decision making with AI-only recalls requiring human arbitration. Standalone AI algorithms used without prompting maintain unbiased screening reading performance, but reading with prompts should be tested prospectively and ideally provided for arbitration.

AB Background Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), applied to baseline [F-18]-FDG PET/CT maximum intensity projections (MIPs), show potential for treatment outcome prediction in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The aim of this study is to investigate the robustness of CNN predictions to different image reconstruction protocols. Baseline [F-18]FDG PET/CT scans were collected from 20 DLBCL patients. EARL1, EARL2 and high-resolution (HR) protocols were applied per scan, generating three images with different image qualities. Image-based transformation was applied by blurring EARL2 and HR images to generate EARL1 compliant images using a Gaussian filter of 5 and 7 mm, respectively. MIPs were generated for each of the reconstructions, before and after image transformation. An in-house developed CNN predicted the probability of tumor progression within 2 years for each MIP. The difference in probabilities per patient was then calculated between both EARL2 and HR with respect to EARL1 (delta probabilities or Delta P). We compared these to the probabilities obtained after aligning the data with ComBat using the difference in median and interquartile range (IQR). Results CNN probabilities were found to be sensitive to different reconstruction protocols (EARL2 Delta P: median = 0.09, interquartile range (IQR) = [0.06, 0.10] and HR Delta P: median = 0.1, IQR = [0.08, 0.16]). Moreover, higher resolution images (EARL2 and HR) led to higher probability values. After image-based and ComBat transformation, an improved agreement of CNN probabilities among reconstructions was found for all patients. This agreement was slightly better after image-based transformation (transformed EARL2 Delta P: median = 0.022, IQR = [0.01, 0.02] and transformed HR Delta P: median = 0.029, IQR = [0.01, 0.03]). Conclusion Our CNN-based outcome predictions are affected by the applied reconstruction protocols, yet in a predictable manner.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE LIME; Stability; Local fidelity; Variational autoencoder
AB For humans to trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is essential for machine learning (ML) models to be interpretable to users. For example, the judicial process requires that AI conclusions must be rigorous and absolutely interpretable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, VAE-SLIME, for providing stable local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (SLIME) based on a variational autoencoder (VAE). LIME is a technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner. Despite the great success of LIME, the most popular method in this category, it has several disadvantages due to its random perturbation-based sampling method. The VAE-SLIME proposed in this paper is specifically designed to address the lack of stability and local fidelity exhibited by LIME for tabular data. VAE-SLIME first employs fixed noise to replace the random Gaussian noise used by the reparameterization trick of the VAE. Then, it uses this new VAE model instead of random perturbation method to generate stable samples. By considering the sequential relationship and flipping of features, a novel explanation stability evaluation metric, the feature sequence stability index (FSSI), is introduced to accurately evaluate the stability of explanations. In a comparison with 6 state-of-the-art approaches on 7 commonly used tabular datasets, the experimental results show beyond doubt that the explanations produced by our approach are most stable, and its local fidelity is 65.17% higher than that of other approaches on average.

AB Concerns about runaway artificial intelligence (AI) -including large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT -are at the forefront of contemporary political, social, and scientific discourse. This commentary provides a first look at ChatGPT's capabilities and limitations in supporting geographic research, critical thinking, learning, and curriculum development. We assessed ChatGPT's geographic knowledge, synthesising abilities, and potential for extrapolation. ChatGPT was employed for writing assistance, research evaluation, curriculum material creation, and content generation. Despite achieving scores of 47% to 55% on an actual exam paper, ChatGPT exhibited shortcomings including the generation of false references. Ethical concerns regarding academic misconduct, model bias, robustness, and toxic output were also identified. We assert that AI and LLMs like ChatGPT have transformative potential in Geography education and knowledge production but demand critical usage. Accordingly, we urge geographers to enhance AI literacy to enable responsible and effective use of these assistive technologies in our academic practice.

AB BackgroundAnatomic virtual hepatectomy with precise liver segmentation for hemilivers, sectors, or Couinaud's segments using conventional three-dimensional simulation is not automated and artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have not yet been applied.MethodsComputed tomography data of 174 living-donor candidates for liver transplantation (training data) were used for developing a new two-step AI algorithm to automate liver segmentation that was validated in another 51 donors (validation data). The Pure-AI (no human intervention) and ground truth (GT, full human intervention) data groups were compared.ResultsIn the Pure-AI group, the median Dice coefficients of the right and left hemilivers were highly similar, 0.95 and 0.92, respectively; sectors, posterior to lateral: 0.86-0.92, and Couinaud's segments 1-8: 0.71-0.89. Labeling of the first-order branch as hemiliver, right or left portal vein perfectly matched; 92.8% of the second-order (sectors); 91.6% of third-order (segments) matched between the Pure-AI and GT data.ConclusionsThe two-step AI algorithm for liver segmentation automates anatomic virtual hepatectomy. The AI-based algorithm correctly divided all hemilivers, and more than 90% of the sectors and segments.

AB Academic publishers have quickly responded to the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) tools on authorship and academic integrity. However, there remains a lack of understanding about AI authorship policies and the attitude of academic journals towards these tools. This study aims to address this gap by examining the AI authorship policies of 300 top academic journals during the period of late-spring 2023. Over half of the journals examined have an AI authorship policy and guidelines for acknowledging AI usage in manuscript preparation. These acknowledgments are typically made in the methods or acknowledgement sections, although some journals have introduced a new, special section on AI usage. The study also found that AI authorship policies may differ depending on the publisher and discipline of the journal. Many publishers have adopted uniform AI authorship policies that are implemented across all journals that they publish. These results are useful for publishers, editors, and researchers who want to learn more about how academic journals are dealing with the emergence of large language models and other AI tools in scholarly communications.

AB This review paper presents the practical development of imaging biomarkers in the scope of the PRIMAGE (PRedictive In silico Multiscale Analytics to support cancer personalized diaGnosis and prognosis, Empowered by imaging biomarkers) project, as a noninvasive and reliable way to improve the diagnosis and prognosis in pediatric oncology. The PRIMAGE project is a European multi-center research initiative that focuses on developing medical imaging-derived artificial intelligence (AI) solutions designed to enhance overall management and decision-making for two types of pediatric cancer: neuroblastoma and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. To allow this, the PRIMAGE project has created an open-cloud platform that combines imaging, clinical, and molecular data together with AI models developed from this data, creating a comprehensive decision support environment for clinicians managing patients with these two cancers. In order to achieve this, a standardized data processing and analysis workflow was implemented to generate robust and reliable predictions for different clinical endpoints. Magnetic resonance (MR) image harmonization and registration was performed as part of the workflow. Subsequently, an automated tool for the detection and segmentation of tumors was trained and internally validated. The Dice similarity coefficient obtained for the independent validation dataset was 0.997, indicating compatibility with the manual segmentation variability. Following this, radiomics and deep features were extracted and correlated with clinical endpoints. Finally, reproducible and relevant imaging quantitative features were integrated with clinical and molecular data to enrich both the predictive models and a set of visual analytics tools, making the PRIMAGE platform a complete clinical decision aid system. In order to ensure the advancement of research in this field and to foster engagement with the wider research community, the PRIMAGE data repository and platform are currently being integrated into the European Federation for Cancer Images (EUCAIM), which is the largest European cancer imaging research infrastructure created to date.

AB Membrane-based separation can offer significant energy savings over conventional separation methods. Given their highly customizable and porous structures, metal-organic frameworks- (MOFs) are considered as next-generation membrane materials that can bring about high separation performance and energy efficiency in various separation applications. Yet, the enormously large number of possible MOF structures necessitates the development and implementation of efficient modeling approaches to expedite the design, discovery, and selection of optimal MOF-based membranes via directing the experimental efforts, time, and resources to the potentially useful membrane materials. With the recent developments in the field of atomic simulations and artificial intelligence methods, a new era of membrane modeling has started. This review focuses on the recent advances made and key strategies used in the modeling of MOF-based membranes and highlight the huge potential of combining atomistic modeling of MOFs with machine learning to explore very large number of MOF membranes and MOF/polymer composite membranes for gas separation. Opportunities and challenges related to the implementation of data-driven approaches to extract useful structure-property relations of MOF-based membranes and to produce design principles for the high-performing MOF-based membranes are discussed.
   Combining advanced simulation techniques and artificial intelligence methods can help reveal unexplored aspects of metal-organic framework (MOF)-based membranes at an unprecedented speed. This review describes potential benefits of implementing joint simulation-AI driven approach in MOF and MOF/polymer membrane research as well as key advances in modeling techniques that can provide more accurate and more detailed results enabling fine-tuning of subsequent experiments.image

AB So far, this pandemic has severely affected the education sector. As education undergoes a brilliant transformation with advancing technology, the digital acquisition of knowledge has yet to find widespread use - virtual exams. Faraway Proctoring offers several advantages of using manual and primarily based technology. Although this allows students to take an exam in any field with specific technical requirements, it eliminates the need for physical research centers. It is cost-effective and easy to plan, which can be challenging to manage, especially during aggressive trials. Finally, the paper discusses the performance characteristics of different styles of web-based inspection systems, along with their limitations and challenges.

AB Coronary artery venous bypass grafts typically fail because of atherosclerosis driven by lipid and macrophage accumulation. Therapy for vein-graft atherosclerosis is limited to statin drugs, which are only modestly effective. We hypothesized that transduction of vein-graft endothelium of fat-fed rabbits with a helper-dependent adenovirus expressing apolipoprotein AI (HDAdApoAI) would reduce lipid and macrophage accumulation. Fat-fed rabbits received bilateral external jugular vein-to-carotid artery interposition grafts. Four weeks later, one graft per rabbit (n = 23 rabbits) was infused with HDAdApoAI and the contralateral graft with HDAdNull. Grafts were harvested 12 weeks later. Paired analyses of grafts were performed, with vein graft cholesterol, intimal lipid, and macrophage con-tent as the primary endpoints. HDAd genomes were detected in all grafts. APOAI mRNA was median 63-fold higher in HDAdApoAI grafts versus HDAdNull grafts (p < 0.001). HDAdApoAI grafts had a mean 15% lower total cholesterol (by mass spectrometry; p = 0.003); mean 19% lower intimal lipid (by oil red O staining; p = 0.02); and mean 13% lower expression of the macrophage marker CD68 (by reverse transcriptase-mediated quantitative PCR; p = 0.008). In vivo transduction of vein-graft endothelium achieves persistent APOAI expression and reduces vein-graft cholesterol, intimal lipid, and CD68 expression. Vascular gene therapy with APOAI has promise for preventing vein-graft failure caused by atherosclerosis.

DT Review
ID DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; DISPARITIES; MINORITY; CARE
AB Health equity is a primary goal of healthcare stakeholders: patients and their advocacy groups, clinicians, other providers and their professional societies, bioethicists, payors and value based care organizations, regulatory agencies, legislators, and creators of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled medical devices. Lack of equitable access to diagnosis and treatment may be improved through new digital health technologies, especially AI/ML, but these may also exacerbate disparities, depending on how bias is addressed. We propose an expanded Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) framework for healthcare AI/ML, describing the sources and impacts of undesirable bias in AI/ML systems in each phase, how these can be analyzed using appropriate metrics, and how they can be potentially mitigated. The goal of these "Considerations" is to educate stakeholders on how potential AI/ML bias may impact healthcare outcomes and how to identify and mitigate inequities; to initiate a discussion between stakeholders on these issues, in order to ensure health equity along the expanded AI/ML TPLC framework, and ultimately, better health outcomes for all.

AB Childhood medulloblastoma is a malignant form of brain tumor that is widely classified into four subgroups based on molecular and genetic characteristics. Accurate classification of these subgroups is crucial for appropriate treatment, monitoring plans, and targeted therapies. However, misclassification between groups 3 and 4 is common. To address this issue, an AI-based R package called MBMethPred was developed based on DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of 763 medulloblastoma samples to classify subgroups using machine learning and neural network models. The developed prediction models achieved a classification accuracy of over 96% for subgroup classification by using 399 CpGs as prediction biomarkers. We also assessed the prognostic relevance of prediction biomarkers using survival analysis. Furthermore, we identified subgroup-specific drivers of medulloblastoma using functional enrichment analysis, Shapley values, and gene network analysis. In particular, the genes involved in the nervous system development process have the potential to separate medulloblastoma subgroups with 99% accuracy. Notably, our analysis identified 16 genes that were specifically significant for subgroup classification, including EP300, CXCR4, WNT4, ZIC4, MEIS1, SLC8A1, NFASC, ASCL2, KIF5C, SYNGAP1, SEMA4F, ROR1, DPYSL4, ARTN, RTN4RL1, and TLX2. Our findings contribute to enhanced survival outcomes for patients with medulloblastoma. Continued research and validation efforts are needed to further refine and expand the utility of our approach in other cancer types, advancing personalized medicine in pediatric oncology.

AB In recent years, identifying road users' behavior and conflicts at intersections have become an essential data source for evaluating traffic safety. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in 2020, more than 50% of fatal and injury crashes occurred at or near intersections, necessitating further investigation. This study developed an innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based video analytic tool to assess intersection safety using surrogate safety measures and non-compliance behavior. To extract the trajectory data, a real-time AI detection model -YOLO-v5 with a tracking framework based on the DeepSORT algorithm was deployed. 54 h of high-resolution video data were collected at six signalized intersections (including three 3-leg and three 4-leg intersections) in Glassboro, New Jersey. Non-compliance behaviors, such as redlight running and pedestrian crossing outside the crosswalk, are captured to better understand the risky behaviors at these locations. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 92% to 98% for detecting and tracking road users' trajectories. Additionally, the developed tool also provided directional traffic volumes, pedestrian volumes, vehicles running a red light, pedestrian crossing outside the crosswalk events, and PET and TTC for crossing conflicts between vehicles. Furthermore, an extreme value theory (EVT) was used to estimate the number of crashes at each intersection utilizing the frequency of PETs and TTCs. Finally, the intersections were ranked based on the calculated score considering the severity of crashes. Overall, the developed tool and the crash estimation, as well as the model and ranking method, can provide valuable information for engineers and policymakers to assess the safety of intersections and implement effective countermeasures to mitigate intersection-involved crashes.

AB Accurate soil moisture datasets are essential to understand the impacts of climate change. However, few studies have evaluated the consistency and drivers of long-term trends in soil moisture among different dataset types (satellite, assimilation, reanalysis, and climate model) at the global scale. Here we analyze the spatiotemporal variations of global surface soil moisture and associated climate dynamics over 1980-2020 using multiple soil moisture datasets, i.e., multi-satellite assimilated remote sensing datasets (ESA CCI), simulated soil moisture based on LSMs (GLDAS, GLEAM, CMIP6), and reanalysis (ECMWF ERA5, MERRA2, CRA-Land). Most of these datasets indicate pervasive drying of global surface soil moisture over the last four decades. Prominent soil moisture drying is detected in North America, Europe, northeastern Asia, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The cross-correlations among the five synthetic soil moisture datasets are the highest between GLEAM and the reanalysis datasets. Using the Aridity Index (AI, the ratio between annual total precipitation and potential evapotranspiration), we find that soil moisture drying is the most intensive in the humid-arid transitional regions with AI ranging 0.8-1.2. Surface soil moisture drying is primarily driven by increases in temperature, followed by ENSO, as indicated by Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA). However, the significance of the impact of ENSO on soil moisture variability is sensitive to the choice of soil moisture dataset used in the MCA.

AB Simple Summary This study presents an AI system for the automatic diagnosis of lung cancer based on lung nodule images from CT scans. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Taiwan, and early detection can improve the survival rate of patients. The system uses a 3D interpretable hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (HSNet) that can recognize different features of lung nodules, such as calcification, margin, texture, sphericity, and malignancy. The system achieves better performance than previous methods, with high accuracy and interpretability.Abstract Lung cancer is typically classified into small-cell carcinoma and non-small-cell carcinoma. Non-small-cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. Low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) can quickly and non-invasively diagnose lung cancer. In the era of deep learning, an artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided diagnosis system can be developed for the automatic recognition of CT images of patients, creating a new form of intelligent medical service. For many years, lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Taiwan, with smoking and air pollution increasing the likelihood of developing the disease. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smoking women has also increased significantly in recent years, resulting in an important public health problem. Early detection of lung cancer and prompt treatment can help reduce the mortality rate of patients with lung cancer. In this study, an improved 3D interpretable hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network named HSNet was developed and validated for the automatic diagnosis of lung cancer based on a collection of lung nodule images. The interpretable AI model proposed in this study, with different training strategies and adjustment of model parameters, such as cyclic learning rate and random weight averaging, demonstrated better diagnostic performance than the previous literature, with results of a four-fold cross-validation procedure showing calcification: 0.9873 & PLUSMN; 0.006, margin: 0.9207 & PLUSMN; 0.009, subtlety: 0.9026 & PLUSMN; 0.014, texture: 0.9685 & PLUSMN; 0.006, sphericity: 0.8652 & PLUSMN; 0.021, and malignancy: 0.9685 & PLUSMN; 0.006.

AB Aim: The overall aim of this proposal is to ameliorate the care of rotator cuff (RC) tear patients by applying an innovative machine learning approach for outcome prediction after arthroscopic repair. Materials and Methods: We applied state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to evaluate the best predictors of the outcome, and 100 RC patients were evaluated at baseline (T0), after 1 month (T1), 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 1 year (T4) from surgical intervention. The outcome measure was the Costant-Murley Shoulder Score, whereas age, sex, BMI, the 36-Item Short-Form Survey, the Simple Shoulder Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score, the Oxford Shoulder Score, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index were considered as predictive factors. Support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), naive Bayes (NB), and random forest (RF) algorithms were employed. Results: Across all sessions, the classifiers demonstrated suboptimal performance when using both the complete and shrunken sets of features. Specifically, the logistic regression (LR) classifier achieved a mean accuracy of 46.5% & PLUSMN; 6%, while the random forest (RF) classifier achieved 51.25% & PLUSMN; 4%. For the shrunken set of features, LR obtained a mean accuracy of 48.5% & PLUSMN; 6%, and RF achieved 45.5% & PLUSMN; 4.5%. No statistical differences were found when comparing the performance metrics of ML algorithms. Conclusions: This study underlines the importance of extending the application of AI methods to new predictors, such as neuroimaging and kinematic data, in order to better record significant shifts in RC patients' prognosis. Limitations: The data quality within the cohort could represent a limitation, since certain variables, such as smoking, diabetes, and work injury, are known to have an impact on the outcome.

AB This exploratory study investigates a human agent's evolving judgements of reliability when interacting with an AI system. Two aims drove this investigation: (1) compare the predictive performance of quantum vs. Markov random walk models regarding human reliability judgements of an AI system and (2) identify a neural correlate of the perturbation of a human agent's judgement of the AI's reliability. As AI becomes more prevalent, it is important to understand how humans trust these technologies and how trust evolves when interacting with them. A mixed-methods experiment was developed for exploring reliability calibration in human-AI interactions. The behavioural data collected were used as a baseline to assess the predictive performance of the quantum and Markov models. We found the quantum model to better predict the evolving reliability ratings than the Markov model. This may be due to the quantum model being more amenable to represent the sometimes pronounced within-subject variability of reliability ratings. Additionally, a clear event-related potential response was found in the electroencephalographic (EEG) data, which is attributed to the expectations of reliability being perturbed. The identification of a trust-related EEG-based measure opens the door to explore how it could be used to adapt the parameters of the quantum model in real time.

AB Food 3D printing is a computer-aided additive manufacturing technology that can transform foods into intricate customized forms. In the past decade, this field has phenomenally advanced and one pressing need is the development of strategies to support process optimization. Among different approaches, a range of modeling methods have been explored to simulate 3D printing processes. This review details the concepts of various modeling techniques considered for simulating 3D printing processes and their application range. Most modeling studies majorly focus on predicting the mechanical behavior of the material supply, modifying the internal texture of printed constructs, and assessing the post-printing stability. The approach can also be used to simulate the dynamics of 3D printing processes, in turn, assisting the design of 3D printers based on material composition, properties, and printing conditions. While most existing works are associated with extrusion-based 3D printing, this article presents scope for expanding avenues with prominent research and commercial interest. The article concludes with challenges and research needs, emphasizing opportunities for computational and data-driven dynamic simulation approaches for multi-faceted applications.

AB Objectives: To provide an ethical analysis of the implications of the usage of artificial intelligence -supported clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in geriatrics. Design: Ethical analysis based on the normative arguments regarding the use of AI-CDSS in geriatrics using a principle-based ethical framework. Setting and Participants: Normative arguments identified in 29 articles on AI-CDSS in geriatrics. Methods: Our analysis is based on a literature search that was done to determine ethical arguments that are currently discussed regarding AI-CDSS. The relevant articles were subjected to a detailed qualitative analysis regarding the ethical considerations Supplementary Datamentioned therein. We then discussed the identified arguments within the frame of the 4 principles of medical ethics according to Beauchamp and Childress and with respect to the needs of frail older adults. Results: We found a total of 5089 articles; 29 articles met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently subjected to a detailed qualitative analysis. We could not identify any systematic analysis of the ethical implications of AI-CDSS in geriatrics. The ethical considerations are very unsystematic and scattered, and the existing literature has a predominantly technical focus emphasizing the technology's utility. In an extensive ethical analysis, we systematically discuss the ethical implications of the usage of AI-CDSS in geriatrics. Conclusions and Implications: AI-CDSS in geriatrics can be a great asset, especially when dealing with patients with cognitive disorders; however, from an ethical perspective, we see the need for further research. By using AI-CDSS, older patients' values and beliefs might be overlooked, and the quality of the doctor-patient relationship might be altered, endangering compliance to the 4 ethical principles of Beauchamp and Childress.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB The US Food and Drug Administration is clearing an increasing number of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-based medical devices through the 510(k) pathway. This pathway allows clearance if the device is substantially equivalent to a former cleared device (ie, predicate). We analysed the predicate networks of cleared AI/ML-based medical devices (cleared between 2019 and 2021), their underlying tasks, and recalls. More than a third of cleared AI/ML-based medical devices originated from non-AI/ML-based medical devices in the first generation. Devices with the longest time since the last predicate device with an AI/ML component were haematology (2001), radiology (2001), and cardiovascular devices (2008). Especially for devices in radiology, the AI/ML tasks changed frequently along the device's predicate network, raising safety concerns. To date, only a few recalls might have affected the AI/ML components. To improve patient care, a stronger focus should be placed on the distinctive characteristics of AI/ML when defining substantial equivalence between a new AI/ML-based medical device and predicate devices.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated various sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry and research, where it has been utilized to efficiently identify new chemical entities with desirable properties. The application of AI algorithms to drug discovery presents both remarkable opportunities and challenges. This review article focuses on the transformative role of AI in medicinal chemistry. We delve into the applications of machine learning and deep learning techniques in drug screening and design, discussing their potential to expedite the early drug discovery process. In particular, we provide a comprehensive overview of the use of AI algorithms in predicting protein structures, drug-target interactions, and molecular properties such as drug toxicity. While AI has accelerated the drug discovery process, data quality issues and technological constraints remain challenges. Nonetheless, new relationships and methods have been unveiled, demonstrating AI's expanding potential in predicting and understanding drug interactions and properties. For its full potential to be realized, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. This review underscores AI's growing influence on the future trajectory of medicinal chemistry and stresses the importance of ongoing synergies between computational and domain experts.

AB This study presents a reliable classification of walking pedestrians and animals using a radar operating in the millimeter waves (mmW) regime. In addition to the defined targets, additional targets were added in an attempt to fool the radar and to present the robustness of the proposed technique. In addition to the classification capabilities, the presented scheme allowed for the ability to detect the range of targets. The classification was achieved using a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which received the recordings from the radar as an input after the pre-processing procedure. Qualitative detection was made possible due to the radar's operation at extremely high frequencies so that even the tiny movements of limbs influenced the detection, thus enabling the high-quality classification of various targets. The classification results presented a high achievable accuracy even in the case where the targets attempted to fool the radar and mimicked other targets. The combination of the use of high frequencies alongside neural-network-based classification demonstrated the superiority of the proposed scheme in this research over the state of the art. The neural network was analyzed with the help of interpretable tools such as explainable AI (XAI) to achieve a better understanding of the DNN's decision-making process and the mechanisms via which it was able to perform multiple tasks at once.

ID COMPUTATION
AB The emergence of Industry 4.0 has revolutionized the industrial sector, enabling the development of compact, precise, and interconnected assets. This transformation has not only generated vast amounts of data but also facilitated the migration of learning and optimization processes to edge devices. Consequently, modern industries can effectively leverage this paradigm through distributed learning to define product quality and implement predictive maintenance (PM) strategies. While computing speeds continue to advance rapidly, the latency in communication has emerged as a bottleneck for fast edge learning, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as PM. To address this issue, we explore Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework. FL entails updating a global AI model on a parameter server (PS) through aggregation of locally trained models from edge devices. We propose an innovative approach: analog aggregation over-the-air of updates transmitted concurrently over wireless channels. This leverages the waveform-superposition property in multi-access channels, significantly reducing communication latency compared to conventional methods. However, it is vulnerable to performance degradation due to channel properties like noise and fading. In this study, we introduce a method to mitigate the impact of channel noise in FL over-the-air communication and computation (FLOACC). We integrate a novel tracking-based stochastic approximation scheme into a standard federated stochastic variance reduced gradient (FSVRG). This effectively averages out channel noise's influence, ensuring robust FLOACC performance without increasing transmission power gain. Numerical results confirm our approach's superior communication efficiency and scalability in various FL scenarios, especially when dealing with noisy channels. Simulation experiments also highlight significant enhancements in prediction accuracy and loss function reduction for analog aggregation in over-the-air FL scenarios.

ID CURRICULUM
AB IntroductionSurveys conducted internationally have found widespread interest in artificial intelligence (AI) amongst medical students. No similar surveys have been conducted in Western Australia (WA) and it is not known how medical students in WA feel about the use of AI in healthcare or their understanding of AI. We aim to assess WA medical students' attitudes towards AI in general, AI in healthcare, and the inclusion of AI education in the medical curriculum.MethodsA digital survey instrument was developed based on a review of available literature and consultation with subject matter experts. The survey was piloted with a group of medical students and refined based on their feedback. We then sent this anonymous digital survey to all medical students in WA (approximately 1539 students). Responses were open from the 7th of September 2021 to the 7th of November 2021. Students' categorical responses were qualitatively analysed, and free text comments from the survey were qualitatively analysed using open coding techniques.ResultsOverall, 134 students answered one or more questions (8.9% response rate). The majority of students (82.0%) were 20-29 years old, studying medicine as a postgraduate degree (77.6%), and had started clinical rotations (62.7%). Students were interested in AI (82.6%), self-reported having a basic understanding of AI (84.8%), but few agreed that they had an understanding of the basic computational principles of AI (33.3%) or the limitations of AI (46.2%). Most students (87.5%) had not received teaching in AI. The majority of students (58.6%) agreed that AI should be part of medical training and most (72.7%) wanted more teaching focusing on AI in medicine. Medical students appeared optimistic regarding the role of AI in medicine, with most (74.4%) agreeing with the statement that AI will improve medicine in general. The majority (56.6%) of medical students were not concerned about the impact of AI on their job security as a doctor. Students selected radiology (72.6%), pathology (58.2%), and medical administration (44.8%) as the specialties most likely to be impacted by AI, and psychiatry (61.2%), palliative care (48.5%), and obstetrics and gynaecology (41.0%) as the specialties least likely to be impacted by AI. Qualitative analysis of free text comments identified the use of AI as a tool, and that doctors will not be replaced as common themes.ConclusionMedical students in WA appear to be interested in AI. However, they have not received education about AI and do not feel they understand its basic computational principles or limitations. AI appears to be a current deficit in the medical curriculum in WA, and most students surveyed were supportive of its introduction. These results are consistent with previous surveys conducted internationally.

AB This review aimed to (1) summarize the results from fixed-timed artificial insemination (TAI) fertility studies performed during the last 27 years; (2) compile and evaluate, as examples from the literature base, the direct comparisons made of specific manipulations to synchronization protocols; (3) evaluate the impact of the TAI programs on the reproductive performance during the breeding season, and (4) provide perspective on the future of TAI programs in beef cattle. A search of the literature published from 1995 to 2021 was conducted to identify experiments in which synchronization of ovulation and TAI in beef cattle was performed. The primary outcome of interest was fertility expressed as pregnancies per TAI. The literature included two search engines, the SIS Web of Science and the US National Library of Medicine Institutes of Health through PubMed. After the initial search and screening, a total of 228 manuscripts were selected containing a total of 272,668 TAI. A dramatic increase in the number of publications and TAIs occurred throughout the years. Most of them were from Brazil and United States, followed by Canada, Argentina, Uruguay, and Australia. Two main types of TAI programs were identified: GnRH-based and E2/P4-based protocols. In terms of GnRH-based programs, two variations were evaluated in the present manuscript. First, we evaluated the effect of the progesterone implant during the protocol. The progesterone implant increased pregnancy/TAI (P/TAI) from 44.3 to 54.3%. Second, the use of a second prostaglandin F2 & alpha; treatment in 5-d CO-synch program increased the P/TAI from 53.2 to 60.9%. In E2/P4-based programs, use of GnRH at TAI increased P/TAI from 54.7 to 59.2% in cows. However, no increase was detected in heifers. Other research showed that use of TAI can increase the overall proportion of the cows pregnant at end of the breeding season and produce earlier calvings compared with bulls. In conclusion, there have been a large number of excellent research studies that have been performed during the last 27 years on TAI in beef cattle. This technology is being utilized successfully in the beef cattle industry. This success is largely because of the valid research that underlies the application of the technology and the economic value of the technology.

AB It is indisputable that the world is currently facing several health challenges, which include outbreaks of diseases. One way to limit the spread of such diseases is to have simple yet efficient bioassays that work well in large-scale operation. To address this issue, a new artificial intelligence (AI) based colorimetric DNA/RNA detection platform was developed using tilapia lake virus as a model. The assay uses a newly formulated indicator dye and colorimetric nucleic acid amplification done in a thermos or a simple heating block to produce visible results that can be observed by the naked eye. To ensure high-throughput screening, an AI-based analysis web application was developed that can be used on computers, tablets, and smartphones to accurately and quickly determine the colorimetric results. With a genetic material extraction procedure that takes only 5 min and requires no equipment, our assay can be completed within an hour from sampling to readout, with 96% accuracy and a sensitivity approaching a single copy of the target virus. The entire assay incubation can be done in a simple thermos, as a substitute for thermal cyclers, rendering its potential use in remote areas where access to electricity is restricted. To demonstrate the versatility of our platform, we modified our testing solution by changing pathogen-specific primers and tested it on various target pathogens that infect humans, animals, and plants. The results were accurate, indicating that the platform has the potential to be used for point-of-care disease diagnosis in the future.

ID POPULATION
AB Objectives To evaluate whether deep learning-based detection algorithms (DLD)-based triaging can reduce outpatient chest radiograph interpretation workload while maintaining noninferior sensitivity.Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent initial chest radiography at the outpatient clinic between June 1 and June 30, 2017. Readers interpreted radiographs with/without a commercially available DLD that detects nine radiologic findings (atelectasis, calcification, cardiomegaly, consolidation, fibrosis, nodules, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and pneumoperitoneum). The reading order was determined in a randomized, crossover manner. The radiographs were classified into negative and positive examinations. In a 50% worklist reduction scenario, radiographs were sorted in descending order of probability scores: the lower half was regarded as negative exams, while the remaining were read with DLD by radiologists. The primary analysis evaluated noninferiority in sensitivity between radiologists reading all radiographs and simulating a 50% worklist reduction, with the inferiority margin of 5%. The specificities were compared using McNemar's test.Results The study included 1964 patients (median age [interquartile range], 55 years [40-67 years]). The sensitivity was 82.6% (195 of 236; 95% CI: 77.5%, 87.3%) when readers interpreted all chest radiographs without DLD and 83.5% (197 of 236; 95% CI: 78.8%, 88.1%) in the 50% worklist reduction scenario. The difference in sensitivity was 0.8% (95% CI: - 3.8%, 5.5%), establishing noninferiority of 50% worklist reduction (p = 0.01). The specificity increased from 86.7% (1498 of 1728) to 90.4% (1562 of 1728) (p < 0.001) with DLD-based triage.Conclusion Deep learning-based triaging may substantially reduce workload without lowering sensitivity while improving specificity.Clinical relevance statement Substantial workload reduction without lowering sensitivity was feasible using deep learning-based triaging of outpatient chest radiograph; however, the legal responsibility for incorrect diagnoses based on AI-standalone interpretation remains an issue that should be defined before clinical implementation.

AB ObjectivesArtificial intelligence (AI) systems can diagnose thyroid nodules with similar or better performance than radiologists. Little is known about how this performance compares with that achieved through fine needle aspiration (FNA). This study aims to compare the diagnostic yields of FNA cytopathology alone and combined with BRAFV600E mutation analysis and an AI diagnostic system.MethodsThe ultrasound images of 637 thyroid nodules were collected in three hospitals. The diagnostic efficacies of an AI diagnostic system, FNA-based cytopathology, and BRAFV600E mutation analysis were evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the & kappa; coefficient with respect to the gold standard, defined by postsurgical pathology and consistent benign outcomes from two combined FNA and mutation analysis examinations performed with a half-year interval.ResultsThe malignancy threshold for the AI system was selected according to the Youden index from a retrospective cohort of 346 nodules and then applied to a prospective cohort of 291 nodules. The combination of FNA cytopathology according to the Bethesda criteria and BRAFV600E mutation analysis showed no significant difference from the AI system in terms of accuracy for either cohort in our multicenter study. In addition, for 45 included indeterminate Bethesda category III and IV nodules, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the AI system were 84.44%, 95.45%, and 73.91%, respectively.ConclusionsThe AI diagnostic system showed similar diagnostic performance to FNA cytopathology combined with BRAFV600E mutation analysis. Given its advantages in terms of operability, time efficiency, non-invasiveness, and the wide availability of ultrasonography, it provides a new alternative for thyroid nodule diagnosis.Clinical relevance statementThyroid ultrasonic artificial intelligence shows statistically equivalent performance for thyroid nodule diagnosis to FNA cytopathology combined with BRAFV600E mutation analysis. It can be widely applied in hospitals and clinics to assist radiologists in thyroid nodule screening and is expected to reduce the need for relatively invasive FNA biopsies.Key Points & BULL; In a retrospective cohort of 346 nodules, the evaluated artificial intelligence (AI) system did not significantly differ from fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytopathology alone and combined with gene mutation analysis in accuracy.& BULL; In a prospective multicenter cohort of 291 nodules, the accuracy of the AI diagnostic system was not significantly different from that of FNA cytopathology either alone or combined with gene mutation analysis.& BULL; For 45 indeterminate Bethesda category III and IV nodules, the AI system did not perform significantly differently from BRAFV600E mutation analysis.Key Points & BULL; In a retrospective cohort of 346 nodules, the evaluated artificial intelligence (AI) system did not significantly differ from fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytopathology alone and combined with gene mutation analysis in accuracy.& BULL; In a prospective multicenter cohort of 291 nodules, the accuracy of the AI diagnostic system was not significantly different from that of FNA cytopathology either alone or combined with gene mutation analysis.& BULL; For 45 indeterminate Bethesda category III and IV nodules, the AI system did not perform significantly differently from BRAFV600E mutation analysis.

AB Driven by the burgeoning growth of the Internet of Everything and the substantial breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) algorithms, a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications keep emerging. Meanwhile, the advance in existing computing paradigms, i.e., cloud computing and edge computing, provide assorted computing solutions to satisfy the increasingly high requirements for ubiquitous AI services. Nevertheless, there are some non-trivial issues in the computing frameworks, including the underutilization of computing power, the self-interest of computing-power trading mechanism, and the inefficiency of AI services management. To tackle the above issues, we propose a computing-power trading framework based on blockchain, also named AI-Bazaar. In AI-Bazaar, the AI consumers play multiple roles and feel free to contribute the computing power rented from the computing-power provider (CPP) for blockchain mining and AI services. Accordingly, we formulate the computing trading problem as a Stackelberg game. Based on the win or learn fast principle (WoLF), we design a profit-balanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (PB-MARL) algorithm to search the AI-Bazaar equilibrium, while finding the balanced profits for AI consumers and CPP. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the satisfactory performance and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB This article introduces a novel distributed model for handling in real-time, edge-based Artificial Intelligence analytics, such as the ones required for smart video surveillance. The novelty of the model relies on decoupling and distributing the services into several decomposed functions which are linked together, creating virtual function chains (VFC model). The model considers both computational and communication constraints. Theoretical, simulation and experimental results have shown that the VFC model can enable the support of heavy-load services to an edge environment while improving the footprint of the service compared to state-of-the art frameworks. In detail, results on the VFC model have shown that it can reduce the total edge cost, compared with a Monolithic and a Simple Frame Distribution models. For experimenting on a real-case scenario, a testbed edge environment has been developed, where the aforementioned models, as well as a general distribution framework (Spark (c)) and an edge-deployement framework (Kubernetes (c)), have been deployed. A cloud service has also been considered. Experiments have shown that VFC can outperform all alternative approaches, by reducing operational cost and improving the QoS. Finally, a caching and a QoS monitoring service based on Long-Term-Short-Term models are introduced and evaluated.

AB Nowadays, virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) plays a vital role in today's mobile edge system for its better support for latency-sensitive applications. However, our characterization of vRAN on modern processors depicts a frustrating picture of Single-Instruction Multi-Data (SIMD) acceleration. Specifically, the existing data arrangement processes cannot efficiently utilize the ports in modern processors, which leads to high backend bound and fails to saturate the memory bandwidth between registers and the L1 cache. To tackle the issue, we thoroughly examine the state-of-the-art CPU architecture and observe the idle ports which could be utilized by the process. Motivated by this observation, we propose an "Arithmetic Ports Consciousness Mechanism" (APCM) utilizing these idle ports to eliminate the backend bound and saturate the memory bandwidth. The APCM decreases the data arrangement's backend bound from 45% to 3% and promotes its memory bandwidth utilization by 4X-16X. Moreover, we illustrate that the APCM can be utilized to promote the performance of typical mobile edge applications such as network routing, image processing, and AI applications. The CPU time of the data arrangement process time of the selected typical mobile edge applications can be reduced by 55$\%$% - 95$\%$% when utilizing the proposed mechanism.

AB With the development and innovation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, users can regulate their social lives and personal emotions through continuous interaction with AI voice assistants or chatbots. Based on the value-based adoption model (VAM), this paper examines the differences between different psychological factors with respect to perceived value factors when using AI voice assistants. This study is of great significance to improving AI voice assistant services and provides an important reference point for deeper understanding of user perception and emotional response to AI voice assistants. The aim of this research is to examine whether the usefulness, enjoyment value, perceived emotional value, and functional value of an AI voice assistant vary according to the user's level of loneliness, resistance to innovation, and infringement of privacy. An online questionnaire created on the Questionnaire Star platform was used in this paper, and a three-way ANOVA was employed using SPSS 21.0 software. The findings suggest that the interaction effects of psychological factors such as loneliness, innovation resistance, and infringement of privacy differ in terms of perceived usefulness and enjoyment when using AI voice assistants, as well as in terms of perceived emotional and functional value. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the application and sustainable development of AI voice assistant technology by companies in different countries and regions. At the same time, this paper provides a valuable reference point for promoting urban economic sustainability in the context of digital technology.

AB Deep learning (DL) has gained increasing prominence in latency-critical artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Due to the intensive computational requirements of these applications, cloud-centric approaches have been attempted to address this issue, but they result in intolerable latency, network congestion, and privacy concerns. An alternative concept called edge intelligence, which combines AI and edge computing, has been proposed to perform DL execution at the edge in multiple resource-constrained devices (RCDs) collaboratively. This paper proposes a relay-assisted, distributed, and collaborative on-device convolutional neural network (CNN) execution scheme for latency-critical applications. The system employs hybrid parallelism, combining both data and model parallelism, to optimize collaborative CNN execution on RCDs. A relay-assisted communication technique is used to reduce the input data size per RCD and avoid excessive point-to-point communication between the data owner RCD and collaborative RCDs. The proposed approach reduces communication overhead using two strategies: layer block formation and optimal filter assignment. These strategies are applied to multiple collaborative RCDs, considering their different computing capabilities and network conditions. Finally, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall energy consumption by jointly optimizing the workload of each RCD in each layer and communication and computation parameters.

The results underscore that AI technology innovations can significantly enhance firms' total factor productivity. Moreover, while this positive impact is generalizable across firms, it is more pronounced in large-size enterprises, state-owned enterprises, and labor-intensive industries. Additionally, the mechanisms analysis reveals that cost reduction, increased utilization of highly skilled labor inputs, facilitation of digital transformation, and improvement in innovation efficiency are mechanisms through which AI technology innovation enhances productivity.

AB For decades, playing Go at a professional level has counted among those things that, in Dreyfus's words, 'computers still can't do'. This changed dramatically in early March 2016, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul, South Korea, when AlphaGo, the most sophisticated Go program at the time, beat Lee Sedol, an internationally top-ranked Go professional, by four games to one. A documentary movie has captured and crafted the unfolding drama and, since AlphaGo's momentous win, the drama has been retold in myriad variations. Yet the exhibition match as a technology demonstration-in short, the 'AlphaGo show'-has not received much scrutiny in STS, notwithstanding or precisely because of all the media frenzy, game commentary, and 'AI' expertise in its wake. This article therefore revisits the second game's 'move 37', its surprise delivery by AlphaGo on stage, and the subsequent line of commentary by the attending experts, initiated by the news-receipt token 'ooh'. Drawing upon a reflexive video analysis, the article explicates the Go move's scenic intelligibility-its embodied delivery as part of the technology demonstration-as the contingent result of intricate 'human/machine interfacing'. For mainstream media to report on AlphaGo's 'superhuman intelligence', it both relied upon and effaced such interfacing work. In turn, the article describes and discusses how 'object agency' and 'algorithmic drama' both trade on skillfully embodied play as a pivotal interfacing practice, informing the exhibition match from within its livestream broadcast.

AB The LuxS quorum sensing system is a widespread system employed by many bacteria for cell-to-cell communication. The luxS gene has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in intramacrophage survival of piscine Streptococcus agalactiae, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, transcriptome analysis, followed by the luxS gene deletion and subsequent functional studies, confirmed that impaired bacterial survival inside macrophages due to the inactivation of luxS was associated with reduced transcription of the fruRKI operon, encoding the fructose-specific phosphotransferase system. Further, luxS was determined not to enhance the transcription of fruRKI operon by binding its promoter, but to upregulate the expression of this operon via affecting the binding ability of catabolite control protein A (CcpA) to the catabolite responsive element (cre) in the promoter of fruRKI. Collectively, our study identifies a novel and previously unappreciated role for luxS in bacterial intracellular survival, which may give a more thorough understanding of the immune evasion mechanism in S. agalactiae.

AB This paper proposes a novel explainable artificial intelligence (AI) driven ensemble machine learning (ML) framework for predicting fertilizer price movements and assessing the contributions of the technical and macroeconomic indicators. We integrate the Boruta algorithm, Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation (MODWT), Random Forest (RF), and explainable AI. The predictive analytics exercise utilises the residual of the previous stage as an additional indicator for arriving at the subsequent stage forecasts. We observe a significant influence of the residual in providing forecasts for time series with higher frequencies. The explainable AI is used at the global and local levels to explain the impacts of the indicators on fertilizer price movements. We have used monthly urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) prices for nearly the last 30 years for predictive analytics. The explainable AI identifies the more significant impacts of the technical indicators compared to macroeconomic counterparts in forecasting urea and DAP prices at the global level. Also, the price movements of urea and DAP are similar at the global level. On the contrary, macroeconomic indicators influence more at the local level. The CBOE volatility index for urea, geopolitical risk, and commodity industrial input for DAP significantly influence the price movements at the local level.

AB A simple acid-induced surfactant assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure, AI-SA-DLLME, is delineated to detect trace impurities in lead-bismuth eutectic, LBE, using ETAAS after simultaneous separation of the major matrix elements such as lead and bismuth. In this process, matrix elements form reactive anionic iodide species, PbI42- and BiI4- in the presence of mixed mineral acids and iodide. These species simultaneously react with cationic head groups of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) hydrophilic dispersing micelles and form extractable hydrophobic ion-associates, PbI42--(CTAB)2 and BiI4--CTAB. These ion associates are extracted from the bulk aqueous phase into a small micelle rich organic phase in the presence of sulphuric acid using chloroform. The extraction efficiency of lead and bismuth is found to be more than 99.4%. The trace impurities such as As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sb, Te and Tl in the aqueous phase are determined using ETAAS. The parameters affecting the process are optimized. Under the optimized conditions, the spike recoveries of impurities are found to be between 90 and 104%, and relative standard deviations within and between the processes are between 2% and 10%; and 6% and 15%, respectively. The accuracy of the procedure is verified by comparing the values obtained from ETAAS with those of ICP-OES. The good agreement between values indicates the validity of the procedures. The limits of detection obtained for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, As, Be, Mn, Sb, Te and Tl are 3, 120, 300, 360, 40, 30, 1, 2, 80, 90 and 40 ng g-1 respectively. This procedure is applied to real Pb-Bi eutectic matrices.
   Analysis of PbBi eutectic after separation of matrix elements by a simple acid-induced surfactant assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure is reported.

AB A square is a word of the form uu, where u is a non-empty word. The square density of a word is the ratio of the number of distinct squares in a word to its length. It is known that in a word w = a1a2 ... an, at most two different rightmost squares can start from a letter ai. A factor of w that begins with two rightmost squares in w is said to be an FS-double square. We identify the structure of words having k consecutive FS-double squares in which at least k locations start with no rightmost squares. We show that the square density of such words is less than 133 81.We select the structure of FS-double squares that minimizes the number of locations starting with no rightmost squares and use it to obtain a new family of words. Every word of the family has consecutive FS -double squares. We then prove that the square density of these words increases with the size of the words and converges to one.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fluid dynamics of water flow through porous metallic media is significant for cooling and heating applications. The prediction of the velocity of fluid flowing inside the porous media could provide useful data for pressure drop calculations. This prediction is usually performed by a mathematical modeling approach like computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computational method is a powerful means of precision calculation, although it could take more time and expenditure for more complex geometries or more complex fluid flow regimes. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms could learn and map CFD data under several conditions. AI algorithms could continue the prediction of physical data, saving computing time and performance. The present study focuses on CFD modeling of water flow inside a pipe filled with copper porous media. For the first time, the fuzzy bee algorithm (BAFIS) maps the generated CFD data to inlet velocities of 0.5, 0.7, 1.1, and 1.3 m/s. The BAFIS intelligence assessment for accurate convective flow prediction in porous media is not available in the literature. Additionally, the reliability of this method for missing CFD data prediction has not been considered yet. The results showed that the maximum intelligence (regression=0.97) is for a bee number of 140. Using the most intelligent BAFIS, the outlet velocity can be predicted by the artificial intelligence method for further nodes and inlet velocities without CFD modeling. BAFIS could precisely predict the outlet velocity for missing data with an inlet velocity of 0.91 m/s based on previously mapped data. A comparison was made between BAFIS and the fuzzy neural network (ANFIS) for CFD data predictions. The mean-square error and the root-mean-square error of ANFIS were slightly more than BAFIS (i.e., 0.1% and 3%, respectively).

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted global energy markets and caused significant socio-economic impacts worldwide, including the energy sector due to lockdowns and restricted economic activity. This paper presents a comprehensive and analytical review of the impact of COVID-19 on the energy sector and explores the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mitigating its effects. This review examines the changes in energy demand patterns during the pre-, mid-, and post-pandemic periods, analyzing their implications for the energy industries, including policymaking, communication, digital technology, energy conversion, the environment, energy markets, and power systems. Additionally, we explore how AI can enhance energy efficiency, optimize energy use, and reduce energy wastage. The potential of AI in developing sustainable energy systems is discussed, along with the challenges it poses in the energy sector's response to the pandemic. The recommendations for AI applications in the energy sector for the transition to a more sustainable energy future, with examples drawn from previous successful studies, are outlined. Information corroborated in this review is expected to provide important guidelines for crafting future research areas and directions in preparing the energy sector for any unforeseen circumstances or pandemic-like situations.

ID MANAGEMENT; RECORDS
AB Electronic health record (EHR) systems collate patient data, and the integration and standardization of documents through Health Information Exchange (HIE) play a pivotal role in refining patient management. Although the clinical implications of AI in EHR systems have been extensively analyzed, its application in HIE as a crucial source of patient data is less explored. Addressing this gap, our systematic review delves into utilizing AI models in HIE, gauging their predictive prowess and potential limitations. Employing databases such as Scopus, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed/Medline, and Web of Science and adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, we unearthed 1021 publications. Of these, 11 were shortlisted for the final analysis. A noticeable preference for machine learning models in prognosticating clinical results, notably in oncology and cardiac failures, was evident. The metrics displayed AUC values ranging between 61% and 99.91%. Sensitivity metrics spanned from 12% to 96.50%, specificity from 76.30% to 98.80%, positive predictive values varied from 83.70% to 94.10%, and negative predictive values between 94.10% and 99.10%. Despite variations in specific metrics, AI models drawing on HIE data unfailingly showcased commendable predictive proficiency in clinical verdicts, emphasizing the transformative potential of melding AI with HIE. However, variations in sensitivity highlight underlying challenges. As healthcare's path becomes more enmeshed with AI, a well-rounded, enlightened approach is pivotal to guarantee the delivery of trustworthy and effective AI-augmented healthcare solutions.

AB Turbo-AI is an iterative Machine-Learning (ML) based channel estimator as an additional option to balance the performance-complexity trade-off and realize challenging scenarios towards future 6th Generation (6G) wireless communications in a complementary manner. In this paper, we move the focus from algorithmic aspects and pure level link investigations, addressed in previous Turbo-AI paper series, to system level exploitation and hardware-related implementation. We integrate Turbo-AI to a 5G compliant system level simulator, through which the performance gap between 5G legacy channel estimator and ML-based channel estimator can be described and quantized to the distributions of channel estimation Mean Squared Error (MSE). Finally, Turbo-AI, representing an important component of future AI/ML-enhanced Physical Layer (PHY), is realized in a hardware platform implementing the New Radio (NR) compliant gNB-functionality, which satisfies the L1 processing latency of the whole Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) chain. The performance advantage of Turbo-AI over the 5G legacy channel estimator is not only reflected in the improved coded Block Error Rate (BLER) curves, but also exhibited by the real-time Radio Frequency (RF) experimentation towards an early adoption of AI/ML-enhanced RAN, seamless model management and performance-latency trade-off, depending on computational resources and system constraints.

In recent times, there has been a merging of AI and IoT technologies to form an "Artificial Intelligence of Things"(AIoT) infrastructure. This integration aims to enhance various aspects such as human-machine interactions, operations in the field of IoT, big data analytics, and more. AIoT-based solutions offer numerous benefits to the manufacturing industry. These solutions improve efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance safety measures. By utilizing AIoT, manufacturers are able to achieve Industry 4.0 goals and increase productivity through automation, process optimization, and more informed decision-making. Additionally, the adoption of AI and IoT-based solutions in manufacturing companies has increased substantially. These solutions enable the early detection and prevention of defects in equipment, leading to the production of high-quality products. By minimizing waste, reducing costs, improving efficiency, and boosting productivity, manufacturers can further optimize their operations. Academic researchers and industry practitioners are currently prioritizing the development of highly advanced and streamlined AIoT-based solutions specifically designed for sustainable manufacturing. The primary objectives of this paper are (i) to provide a comprehensive overview of the domain-centric AIoT-based industry technology for sustainable manufacturing; (ii) to conduct a thorough survey of the existing research on AIoTenabled manufacturing; (iii) to discuss the current challenges faced by AIoT in the context of sustainable manufacturing and explore the research prospects in this field. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic review of state-of-the-art AIoT-based techniques employed in industries for sustainable manufacturing and analyzes the key contributions and opportunities. Finally, the key challenges are explained for future research prospects.

AB The machine learning frameworks flourished in the last decades, allowing artificial intelligence to get out of academic circles to be applied to enterprise domains. This field has significantly advanced, but there is still some meaningful improvement to reach the subsequent expectations. The proposed framework, named AI(2), uses a natural language interface that allows non-specialists to benefit from machine learning algorithms without necessarily knowing how to program with a programming language. The primary contribution of the AI(2 )framework allows a user to call the machine learning algorithms in English, making its interface usage easier. The second contribution is greenhouse gas (GHG) awareness. It has some strategies to evaluate the GHG generated by the algorithm to be called and to propose alternatives to find a solution without executing the energy-intensive algorithm. Another contribution is a preprocessing module that helps to describe and to load data properly. Using an English text-based chatbot, this module guides the user to define every dataset so that it can be described, normalized, loaded, and divided appropriately. The last contribution of this paper is about explainability. The scientific community has known that machine learning algorithms imply the famous black-box problem for decades. Traditional machine learning methods convert an input into an output without being able to justify this result. The proposed framework explains the algorithm's process with the proper texts, graphics, and tables. The results, declined in five cases, present usage applications from the user's English command to the explained output. Ultimately, the AI(2) framework represents the next leap toward native language based, human-oriented concerns about machine learning framework.

AB Inspecting the number of rebars in each column of a reinforced concrete (RC) structure is a significant task that must be undertaken during the rebar inspection process. Conventionally, counting the rebars has relied on a manual inspection carried out by visiting inspectors. However, this approach is very time-consuming, labor-intensive, and poses a potential safety risk. Previous studies have focused on the applications of counting the rebars for a production line and/or warehouse, using vision-based methods. Therefore, this study aims to propose an innovative approach incorporating the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on real construction sites to count the rebars automatically. For analyzing the images, robust object detection methods based on deep learning (Faster R-CNN, R-FCN, SSD 300, SSD500, YOLOv5, and YOLOv6) were developed. A total of 384 models generated from six different methods were trained and implemented using data sets based on the original and augmented images with adjustments made for the hyperparameters. In a test, the best optimized model based on Faster R-CNN produced an accuracy of 94.61% at AP50. In addition, video testing demonstrated a coverage of up to 32 frames per second in the experimental environment, suggesting that this method has potential for real-time application.
   Drones provide an efficient way to monitor the number of rebars in reinforced columns by capturing still images or video footage. However, manually counting the rebars from this data in the form of images is both time-consuming and laborious. This research therefore develops an AI-driven technique, based on deep learning, designed to automate the process. In the experiment, the approach that was developed achieved an accuracy rate of 94.61% under diverse conditions on real construction sites, including nonuniform illumination and complex backgrounds (e.g., scaffolding and molding). Nevertheless, there is potential for further improvement in certain scenarios (e.g., where there are shadows in high-illumination images, or similar objects close to the rebars). In addition, video testing demonstrated that the system could process up to 32 frames per s. Despite its limitations, the method developed in this research could be put to practical use on construction sites, except in those scenarios where it showed a lower rate of accuracy. Moreover, as 30 frames per s is often regarded as equivalent to real-time, it would also be feasible to use it for video analytics' applications such as real-time monitoring and progress tracking.

AB Background: We aimed to assess the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) based real-time anatomy identification for ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve and plane block in eight regions in this prospective observational study.
   Methods: After obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed consent from 40 healthy volunteers (20 men and 20 women, between 18 and 72 years old), an ultrasound device installed with AI software (Nerveblox, SmartAlfa, Turkey) were used to scan regions of the cervical plexus, brachial plexus, pectoralis (PECS), rectus sheet, femoralis, canalis adductorius, popliteal, and ESP by three anesthesiology trainees. During scanning by a trainee, once software indicates 100 % scan success of associated anatomic landmarks, both raw and labeled ultrasound images were saved, assessed, and validated using a 6-point scale between 0 and 5 by two expert validators. Evaluation scores of the validators for each block were compared according to demographics (gender, age, and BMI) and block type exists.
   Results: The scores were not different except ESP, femoralis, and cervical plexus regions between the experts. The mean scores of the experts for the PECS, popliteal and rectus sheath were significant between males and females (p < 0.05). In terms of BMI, significant differences in the scores were observed only in the canalis adductorius, brachial plexus, and ESP regions (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Ultrasound guided AI-based anatomy identification was performed in commonly used eight block regions by the trainees where AI technology can successfully interpret the anatomical structures in real-time sonography which would be valuable in assisting anesthesiologists.

AB Backgrounde-Health has played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic in primary health care. e-Health is the cost-effective and secure use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to support health and health-related fields. Various stakeholders worldwide use ICTs, including individuals, non-profit organizations, health practitioners, and governments. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT has improved the quality of healthcare, the exchange of information, training of healthcare professionals and patients, and facilitated the relationship between patients and healthcare providers. This study systematically reviews the literature on ICT-based automatic and remote monitoring methods, as well as different ICT techniques used in the care of COVID-19-infected patients.ObjectiveThe purpose of this systematic literature review is to identify the e-Health methods, associated ICTs, method implementation strategies, information collection techniques, advantages, and disadvantages of remote and automatic patient monitoring and care in COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsThe search included primary studies that were published between January 2020 and June 2022 in scientific and electronic databases, such as EBSCOhost, Scopus, ACM, Nature, SpringerLink, IEEE Xplore, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, JMIR, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. In this review, the findings from the included publications are presented and elaborated according to the identified research questions. Evidence-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework. Additionally, we improved the review process using the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles (SANRA). Among the eligibility criteria were methodological rigor, conceptual clarity, and useful implementation of ICTs in e-Health for remote and automatic monitoring of COVID-19 patients.ResultsOur initial search identified 664 potential studies; 102 were assessed for eligibility in the pre-final stage and 65 articles were used in the final review with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The review identified the following eHealth methods-Telemedicine, Mobile Health (mHealth), and Telehealth. The associated ICTs are Wearable Body Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, Internet-of-Things, or Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoT or IoMT), Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), and Bluetooth-enabled (BLE) home health monitoring devices. Spatial or positional data, personal and individual health, and wellness data, including vital signs, symptoms, biomedical images and signals, and lifestyle data are examples of information that is managed by ICTs. Different AI and IoT methods have opened new possibilities for automatic and remote patient monitoring with associated advantages and weaknesses. Our findings were represented in a structured manner using a semantic knowledge graph (e.g., ontology model).ConclusionsVarious e-Health methods, related remote monitoring technologies, different approaches, information categories, the adoption of ICT tools for an automatic remote patient monitoring (RPM), advantages and limitations of RMTs in the COVID-19 case are discussed in this review. The use of e-Health during the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the constraints and possibilities of using ICTs. ICTs are not merely an external tool to achieve definite remote and automatic health monitoring goals; instead, they are embedded in contexts.
   Therefore, the importance of the mutual design process between ICT and society during the global health crisis has been observed from a social informatics perspective. A global health crisis can be observed as an information crisis (e.g., insufficient information, unreliable information, and inaccessible information); however, this review shows the influence of ICTs on COVID-19 patients' health monitoring and related information collection techniques.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, yet little is known about how consumers experience medical AI and make decisions about using these providers for follow-up care. We take an interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioral and neuroimaging experiments to determine how anthropomorphism and personalization influence consumers' well-being and their decisions about a provider for follow-up care. Study 1 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, consumers are likely to experience a heightened sense of well-being after a highly personalized medical consultation. However, regardless of whether the first interaction is highly personalized or not, they prefer follow-up visits with a human doctor, as mediated through empathy. Study 2 finds that, regardless of the type of medical provider used, the anterior cingulate cortex shows greater activation in a highly (vs. low) personalized interaction, the activation of which is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit that provider. Furthermore, the temporal occipital fusiform cortex shows greater activation in consultations with a human doctor (vs. medical AI), regardless of the interaction's level of personalization. The level of activation is also correlated with consumers' willingness to revisit with the initial provider. The findings suggest that medical AI cannot currently replace human doctors and that human doctors remain consumers' choice for medical consultations and treatment.

AB ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess the capabilities of ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) in generating informative content related to bipolar disorders. The objectives were to evaluate its ability to provide accurate information on symptoms, classification, causes, and management of bipolar disorder and to explore its creativity in generating topic-related songs.MethodsChatGPT3 was used for the study, and a series of clinically relevant questions were asked to test its knowledge and creativity. Questions ranged from common symptom descriptions to more artistic requests for songs related to bipolar disorder.ResultsChatGPT demonstrated the capacity to provide basic and informative material on bipolar disorders, including descriptions of symptoms, classification types, causes, and treatment options. It also showed creativity in generating songs that capture the nuances of bipolar symptoms, both during high and low states.ConclusionsWhile ChatGPT3 can offer superficial information on psychiatric topics like bipolar disorder, its inability to provide accurate and up-to-date references limits its utility for creating a comprehensive review article for scientific journals. However, it may be helpful in generating educational material and assisting in component tasks for those with bipolar disorder or other psychiatric conditions. As newer versions of AI models are continually developed, their capabilities in producing more accurate and advanced content will need further evaluation.

AB Algorithmic decision-making has the potential to radically reshape policy-making and policy implementation. Many of the moral examinations of AI in government take AI to be a neutral epistemic tool or the value-driven analogue of a policymaker. In this paper, I argue that AI systems in public administration are often better analogised to a street-level bureaucrat. Doing so opens up a host of questions about the moral dispositions of such AI systems. I argue that AI systems in public administration often act as indifferent bureaucrats, and that this can introduce a problematic homogeneity in the moral dispositions in administrative agencies.

AB PurposeDigitalization is revolutionizing the retail sector as today's consumers prefer a seamlessly integrated, fluid and irritation-free shopping experience enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technologies. Literature highlights gaps in the understanding of the shopping experience in an omnichannel context, involving aesthetic, cognitive and affective experience dimensions. This research highlights the direct effects and the mechanism triggered in the presence of such device.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 259 consumers was interviewed at the point of sale. Data have been collected after a shopping experience in two concept stores belonging to the same fashion brand: (1) not equipped with AI-powered technology and (2) equipped with these tools. The measurement scales were validated through ANCOVA analysis and causal relationship analysis with structural equation modeling.FindingsThe results show that the presence of an in-store AI-powered technologies in a connected store generates a higher aesthetic reaction when visiting the store, a higher absorption when shopping through the flow and a higher intent to purchase. The authors further investigate the underlying mechanism triggered by the presence of this technology, which enables the authors to outline their consequences regarding purchase intention.Originality/valueThe study, conducted within an actual connected store in France, explores the impact of AI technology in connected retail environments on consumer responses. It is an early research in this field, shedding light on a rarely explored area. The authors' research addresses a significant gap, providing insights into AI-driven retail experiences.

AB IntroductionThe advent of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) has recently changed the workflow of radiation treatments by ensuring highly collimated treatments. Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics are tools that have shown promising results for diagnosis, treatment optimization and outcome prediction. This review aims to assess the impact of AI and radiomics on modern IGRT modalities in RT.MethodsA PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase systematic review was conducted to investigate the impact of radiomics and AI to modern IGRT modalities. The search strategy was "Radiomics" AND "Cone Beam Computed Tomography"; "Radiomics" AND "Magnetic Resonance guided Radiotherapy"; "Radiomics" AND "on board Magnetic Resonance Radiotherapy"; "Artificial Intelligence" AND "Cone Beam Computed Tomography"; "Artificial Intelligence" AND "Magnetic Resonance guided Radiotherapy"; "Artificial Intelligence" AND "on board Magnetic Resonance Radiotherapy" and only original articles up to 01.11.2022 were considered.ResultsA total of 402 studies were obtained using the previously mentioned search strategy on PubMed and Embase. The analysis was performed on a total of 84 papers obtained following the complete selection process. Radiomics application to IGRT was analyzed in 23 papers, while a total 61 papers were focused on the impact of AI on IGRT techniques.DiscussionAI and radiomics seem to significantly impact IGRT in all the phases of RT workflow, even if the evidence in the literature is based on retrospective data. Further studies are needed to confirm these tools' potential and provide a stronger correlation with clinical outcomes and gold-standard treatment strategies.

AB For the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems into medical processes it is decisive to address both the trustworthiness of these systems and the trust that physicians and patients have in those systems. Too much trust can result in physicians uncritically relying on this technology, while too little trust may result in physicians not taking advantage of the full potential of AI-based technology in making decisions. To strike a balance between these extremes it is crucial to correctly assess the trustworthiness of a system. Only in this way is it possible to decide whether or the system can be trusted or not. This article describes these relationships for the medical context. We show why trustworthiness and trust are important in the use of AI-based systems and how individuals can come to an accurate assessment of the trustworthiness of AI-based systems.

AB The concept of Industry 5.0 (I5.0) promotes the human-centricity as the core value behind the evolution of smart manufacturing systems (SMSs), based on a novel use of digital technologies in the design and management of modern industrial systems to take up the socio-technical challenges. In this context, the paper proposes a Smart Manufacturing Systems Design (SMSD) framework enabling I5.0, based on the human-automation symbiosis. Thanks to an 'Augmented Digital Twin' (ADT) able to integrate and digitize all the entities of the factory (i.e. machines, robots, environments, interfaces, people), AI-driven applications can be built to support the user domain and make people and machines co-evolve thanks to a systematic data sharing between physical and digital assets (e.g. digital twin, virtual mock-ups, human-machine interfaces), optimizing factory productivity and workers wellbeing. In this framework, machines and humans can both generate knowledge and learn from each other, generating a virtuous co-evolution, supporting the understanding of the human-machine interplay and the creation of an effective collaboration between people and SMSs. The framework was conceived and validated involving four industrial companies, belonging to diverse sectors, interested in overcoming the current limits of I4.0 lines by including the human factors for future SMS management.

AB Digital technology is reshaping workplaces by enabling spatial separation of offices, known as telework, or remote intelligence (RI) and by facilitating automation of service sector tasks via artificial intelligence (AI). This paper is the first attempt to empirically investigate whether AI and RI are complements or substitutes in the service sector. It uses a worker-level panel of surveys collected from around 10,000 workers from pre-COVID-19 pandemic to late 2022. We find preliminary evidence that suggests that AI and RI are complements rather than substitutes. The evidence comes first from the positive correlation of investments in AI-promoting and RI-promoting software at the firm and worker level, and second from the positive correlation of workers' expectations regarding telework and software automation. The evidence is far from definitive but suggests that the complement-substitution question is a fruitful line for future research.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) education has gained popularity, and educators are developing activities to enhance students' AI literacy and promote collaboration in problem-solving. While current approaches using simulations and games can improve students' AI knowledge, they may not adequately prepare them for higher-level cognitive tasks. Only a few studies have explored the use of maker education to develop students' AI literacy. This case study employed a mixed-method approach and integrated AI into maker education to enhance students' motivation, career interest, confidence, collaboration, and AI literacy across low to high cognitive domains. The study involved 35 secondary school students in an AI maker program, where AI-driven recycling bins were employed as a project-based learning intervention. The results demonstrated a positive impact on students' motivation, AI literacy, and collaboration. The study provides design principles and an instructional design framework to assist future educators in creating meaningful maker-based learning experiences in AI education. It highlights the potential of using maker education to enhance students' AI literacy and offers guidance to educators on developing effective AI maker activities. The article also discusses theoretical contributions and practical implications for future research.

AB Objective: This study aims to explore the clinical application of an AI-3D reconstruction system in measuring lung volume and analyze its practical value in donor-recipient size matching in lung transplantation.Methods: The study retrospectively collected data from 75 subjects who underwent a plethysmography examination and lung CT at the First Hospital of Jilin University. General data and information related to lung function, and imaging results were collected. The correlation between actual total lung volume (aTLV), predicted total lung volume (pTLV), and artificial intelligence three-dimensional reconstruction CT lung volume (AI-3DCTVol) was analyzed for the overall, male, and female groups. The correlation coefficient and the absolute error percentage with pTLV and AI-3DCTVol were obtained.Results: In the overall, male, and female groups, there were statistical differences (p <0.05) between the pTLV formula and AI-3D reconstruction compared to the plethysmography examination value. The ICC between pTLV and aTLV for all study participants was 0.788 (95% CI: 0.515-0.893), p <0.001. Additionally, the ICC value between AI-3D reconstruction and aTLV was 0.792 (95% CI: 0.681-0.866), p <0.001. For male study participants, the ICC between pTLV and aTLV was 0.330 (95% CI: 0.032-0.617), p = 0.006. Similarly, the ICC value between AI-3D reconstruction and aTLV was 0.413 (95% CI: 0.089-0.662), p = 0.007. In the case of female research subjects, the ICC between pTLV and aTLV was 0.279 (95% CI: 0.001-0.523), p = 0.012. Further, the ICC value between AI-3D reconstruction and aTLV was 0.615 (95% CI: 0.561-0.870), p <0.001.Conclusion: The AI-3D reconstruction, as a convenient method, has significant potential for application in lung transplantation.

ID DIAGNOSIS; MODEL
AB Heart failure (HF) is a heterogeneous syndrome affecting more than 60 million individuals globally. Despite recent advancements in understanding of the pathophysiology of HF, many issues remain including residual risk despite therapy, understanding the pathophysiology and phenotypes of patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction, and the challenges related to integrating a large amount of disparate information available for risk stratification and management of these patients. Risk prediction algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI) may have superior predictive ability compared to traditional methods in certain instances. AI algorithms can play a pivotal role in the evolution of HF care by facilitating clinical decision making to overcome various challenges such as allocation of treatment to patients who are at highest risk or are more likely to benefit from therapies, prediction of adverse outcomes, and early identification of patients with subclinical disease or worsening HF. With the ability to integrate and synthesize large amounts of data with multidimensional interactions, AI algorithms can supply information with which physicians can improve their ability to make timely and better decisions. In this review, we provide an overview of the AI algorithms that have been developed for establishing early diagnosis of HF, phenotyping HF with preserved ejection fraction, and stratifying HF disease severity. This review also discusses the challenges in clinical deployment of AI algorithms in HF, and the potential path forward for developing future novel learning-based algorithms to improve HF care.

To identify relevant topics for educational strategy development, we focused on virtual reality, telehealth, natural language processing, smartphone applications, robotics, genomics, and artificial intelligence. A bibliometric analysis limited to 2018-2023 was performed to identify trends and emerging applications within each topic. Based on the results, a questionnaire was developed and made available online to all Italian pediatricians. The results were analyzed through descriptive analysis and a multivariable logistic regression to explore associations between technology adoption and sociodemographic characteristics.ResultsA total of 3,253 publications were found, with Telehealth and Telemedicine having the highest number of publications and Natural Language Processing the lowest. The number of respondents to the online questionnaire was 1,540, predominantly medical doctors with over 20 years of experience working as family pediatricians. Telehealth had the highest level of knowledge (95.2%), followed by smartphone applications (89.1%) and genomics (63.2%). The greatest potential for increased use through education programs was projected for natural language processing (+ 43.1%), artificial intelligence (+ 39.6%), and virtual and mixed reality (+ 38.1%). Female respondents and older individuals were less likely to use emerging technologies. Hospital pediatricians and residents were more likely to use AI.ConclusionsWe developed a replicable strategy to identify emerging themes in medical technologies relevant to pediatrics and assess the educational needs of pediatricians. A significant gap still exists between current and potential usage of emerging technologies among Italian pediatricians although they showed a positive attitude towards implementing these technologies following specific education programs. The study highlights the need for comprehensive education programs on emerging technologies in pediatrics and recommends addressing gender and age disparities in technology adoption.

TI Validation of prediction algorithm for risk estimation of intracranial
   aneurysm development using real-world data
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID UNRUPTURED CEREBRAL ANEURYSMS; PREVALENCE; ANGIOGRAPHY
AB Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is difficult to detect, and most patients remain undiagnosed, as screening tests have potential risks and high costs. Thus, it is important to develop risk assessment system for efficient and safe screening strategy. Through previously published research, we have developed a prediction model for the incidence risk of IA using cohort observational data. This study was designed to verify whether such a prediction model also demonstrates sufficient clinical performance in predicting the prevalence risk at the point of health screening, using cross-sectional data. The study population comprised individuals who visited the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital Health Promotion Center in Korea for voluntary medical checkups between 2007 and 2019. All participants had no history of cerebrovascular disease and underwent brain CTA for screening purpose. Presence of IA was evaluated by two specialized radiologists. The risk score was calculated using the previously developed AI model, and 0 point represents the lowest risk and 100 point represents the highest risk. To compare the prevalence according to the risk, age-sex standardization using national database was performed. A study collected data from 5942 health examinations, including brain CTA data, with participants ranging from 20 to 87 years old and a mean age of 52 years. The age-sex standardized prevalence of IA was 3.20%. The prevalence in each risk group was 0.18% (lowest risk, 0-19), 2.12% (lower risk, 20-39), 2.37% (mid-risk, 40-59), 4.00% (higher risk, 60-79), and 6.44% (highest risk, 80-100). The odds ratio between the lowest and highest risk groups was 38.50. The adjusted proportions of IA patients in the higher and highest risk groups were 26.7% and 44.5%, respectively. The median risk scores among IA patients and normal participants were 74 and 54, respectively. The optimal cut-off risk score was 60.5 with an area under the curve of 0.70. We have confirmed that the incidence risk prediction model built through machine learning also shows viable clinical performance in predicting prevalence risk. By utilizing this prediction system, we can effectively predict not only the incidence risk but also the prevalence risk, which is the probability of already having the disease, using health screening data. This may enable us to consider strategies for the early detection of intracranial aneurysms.

AB Research question: Can an automated sperm injection robot perform Automated Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSIA) for use in human IVF? Design: The ICSIA robot automated the sperm injection procedure, including injection pipette advancement, zona pellucida and oolemma penetration with piezo pulses, and pipette removal after sperm release. The robot was first tested in mouse, hamster and rabbit oocytes, and subsequently using discarded human oocytes injected with microbeads. A small clinical pilot trial was conducted with donor oocytes to study the feasibility of the robot in a clinical setting. The ICSIA robot was controlled by engineers with no micromanipulation experience. Results were compared with those obtained with manual ICSI conducted by experienced embryologists. Results: The ICSIA robot demonstrated similar results to the manual procedure in the different animal models tested as well as in the pre-clinical validations conducted in discarded human oocytes. In the clinical validation, 13 out of 14 oocytes injected with ICSIA fertilized correctly versus 16 out of 18 in the manual control; eight developed into good-quality blastocysts versus 12 in the manual control; and four were diagnosed as chromosomally normal versus 10 euploid in the manual control. Three euploid blastocysts from the ICSIA robot group have been transferred into two recipients, which resulted in two singleton pregnancies and two babies born. Conclusions: The ICSIA robot showed high proficiency in injecting animal and human oocytes when operated by inexperienced personnel. The preliminary results obtained in this first clinical pilot trial are within key performance indicators.

DT Article
ID RADIOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENT; INTRAOBSERVER; VARIABILITY; PATIENT
AB This study proposes a convolutional neural network method for automatic vertebrae detection and Cobb angle (CA) measurement on X-ray images for scoliosis. 1021 full-length X-ray images of the whole spine of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) were used for training and segmentation. The proposed AI algorithm's results were compared with those of the manual method by six doctors using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICCs recorded by six doctors and AI were excellent or good, with a value of 0.973 for the major curve in the standing position. The mean error between AI and doctors was not affected by the angle size, with AI tending to measure 1.7 & DEG;-2.2 & DEG; smaller than that measured by the doctors. The proposed method showed a high correlation with the doctors' measurements, regardless of the CA size, doctors' experience, and patient posture. The proposed method showed excellent reliability, indicating that it is a promising automated method for measuring CA in patients with AIS.

AB In this study, we enhance the synaptic behavior of artificial synaptic transistors by utilizing nanowire (NW)-type polysilicon channel structures. The high surface-to-volume ratio of the NW channels enables efficient modulation of the channel conductance, which is interpreted as the synaptic weight. As a result, NW-type synaptic transistors exhibit a larger hysteresis window compared to film-type synaptic transistors, even within the same gate voltage sweeping range. Moreover, NW-type synaptic transistors demonstrate superior short-term facilitation and long-term memory transition compared with film-type ones, as evidenced by the measured paired-pulse facilitation and excitatory post-synaptic current characteristics at varying frequencies and pulse numbers. Additionally, we observed gradual potentiation/depression characteristics, making these artificial synapses applicable to artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the NW-type synaptic transistors exhibit improved Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition rate of 91.2%. In conclusion, NW structure channels are expected to be a promising technology for next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors, and the integration of NW structure channels has significant potential to advance AI semiconductor technology.

AB Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder affecting millions worldwide, with a substantial number of patients facing drug-resistant epilepsy. This comprehensive review explores innovative therapies for epilepsy management, focusing on their principles, clinical evidence, and potential applications. Traditional antiseizure medications (ASMs) form the cornerstone of epilepsy treatment, but their limitations necessitate alternative approaches. The review delves into cutting-edge therapies such as responsive neurostimulation (RNS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), highlighting their mechanisms of action and promising clinical outcomes. Additionally, the potential of gene therapies and optogenetics in epilepsy research is discussed, revealing groundbreaking findings that shed light on seizure mechanisms. Insights into cannabidiol (CBD) and the ketogenic diet as adjunctive therapies further broaden the spectrum of epilepsy management. Challenges in achieving seizure control with traditional therapies, including treatment resistance and individual variability, are addressed. The importance of staying updated with emerging trends in epilepsy management is emphasized, along with the hope for improved therapeutic options. Future research directions, such as combining therapies, AI applications, and non-invasive optogenetics, hold promise for personalized and effective epilepsy treatment. As the field advances, collaboration among researchers of natural and synthetic biochemistry, clinicians from different streams and various forms of medicine, and patients will drive progress toward better seizure control and a higher quality of life for individuals living with epilepsy.

AB Simple Summary In this study, we evaluated the performance of a previous validated artificial intelligence-based assessment algorithm using line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) to diagnose actinic keratosis (AK). The AI system accurately graded AK lesions in a large patient cohort and showed high agreement with visual assessments by experts. This non-invasive and fast AI-based approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of AK diagnosis, leading to better clinical outcomes for patients.Abstract Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common skin cancer in situ that can progress to invasive SCC. Line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) has emerged as a non-invasive imaging technique that can aid in diagnosis. Recently, machine-learning algorithms have been developed that can automatically assess the PRO score of AKs based on the dermo-epidermal junction's (DEJ's) protrusion on LC-OCT images. A dataset of 19.898 LC-OCT images from 80 histologically confirmed AK lesions was used to test the performance of a previous validated artificial intelligence (AI)-based LC-OCT assessment algorithm. AI-based PRO score assessment was compared to the imaging experts' visual score. Additionally, undulation of the DEJ, the number of protrusions detected within the image, and the maximum depth of the protrusions were computed. Our results show that AI-automated PRO grading is highly comparable to the visual score, with an agreement of 71.3% for the lesions evaluated. Furthermore, this AI-based assessment was significantly faster than the regular visual PRO score assessment. The results confirm our previous findings of the pilot study in a larger cohort that the AI-based grading of LC-OCT images is a reliable and fast tool to optimize the efficiency of visual PRO score grading. This technology has the potential to improve the accuracy and speed of AK diagnosis and may lead to better clinical outcomes for patients.

AB Background. Biobanks are vital research infrastructures aiming to collect, process, store, and distribute biological specimens along with associated data in an organized and governed manner. Exploiting diverse datasets produced by the biobanks and the downstream research from various sources and integrating bioinformatics and "omics" data has proven instrumental in advancing research such as cancer research. Biobanks offer different types of biological samples matched with rich datasets comprising clinicopathologic information. As digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) have entered the precision medicine arena, biobanks are progressively transitioning from mere biorepositories to integrated computational databanks. Consequently, the application of AI and machine learning on these biobank datasets holds huge potential to profoundly impact cancer research. Methods. In this paper, we explore how AI and machine learning can respond to the digital evolution of biobanks with flexibility, solutions, and effective services. We look at the different data that ranges from specimen-related data, including digital images, patient health records and downstream genetic/genomic data and resulting "Big Data" and the analytic approaches used for analysis. Results. These cutting-edge technologies can address the challenges faced by translational and clinical research, enhancing their capabilities in data management, analysis, and interpretation. By leveraging AI, biobanks can unlock valuable insights from their vast repositories, enabling the identification of novel biomarkers, prediction of treatment responses, and ultimately facilitating the development of personalized cancer therapies. Conclusions. The integration of biobanking with AI has the potential not only to expand the current understanding of cancer biology but also to pave the way for more precise, patient-centric healthcare strategies.

AB Scoring polysomnography for obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis is a laborious, long, and costly process. Machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks, can reduce scoring time and costs. However, most methods require prior filtering and preprocessing of the raw signal. Our work presents a novel method for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea using a transformer neural network with learnable positional encoding, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions. This approach has the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of oximetry for obstructive sleep apnea and reduce the time and costs associated with traditional polysomnography. Contrary to existing approaches, our approach performs annotations at one-second granularity. Allowing physicians to interpret the model's outcome. In addition, we tested different positional encoding designs as the first layer of the model, and the best results were achieved using a learnable positional encoding based on an autoencoder with structural novelty. In addition, we tried different temporal resolutions with various granularity levels from 1 to 360 s. All experiments were carried out on an independent test set from the public OSASUD dataset and showed that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions with a satisfactory AUC of 0.89, accuracy of 0.80, and F1-score of 0.79.

AB The Philippines' real estate (RE) market vis a vis its government's collective efforts to accelerate its digital transformation faces prevalent illegal RE practices online on top of limited publicly accessible data for decision-making and decentralized and highly regional RE markets. As the middle-income millennials' and Gen Zs' purchasing power rises, these increasingly important consumer groups might fall prey to online RE colorums or make bad RE investment decisions. In anticipation of big data, ML, and AI becoming integral to the Philippine RE industry, this study extends the theory of the planned behavior model to account for RE investment and illegal practice and to build a theoretical basis for foundational models. A total of 400 Filipinos aged 15 to 42 from different regions in the country responded to a self-administered online survey questionnaire. The model was assessed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and was proven to be sufficient to explain the proposed model. Results from the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) revealed that during inflation, risk tolerance (RT), perceived property value (PPV), and aversion from illegal practice (IP) significantly influence millennials' and Gen Zs' intention to invest in the RE market, implying that they would consider prioritizing profitability at the expense of sustainability. Thus, a collective commitment to provide transparent and real-time data on RE KPIs and projects is necessary for safer and optimized operations while ensuring the sustainability of current and future projects.

AB In 2023, the global use of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and -4, witnessed a significant surge, sparking discussions on its sustainable implementation across various domains, including education from primary schools to universities. However, practical testing and evaluation in school education are still relatively unexplored. This article examines the utilization of generative AI in primary school education. The study involved 110 pupils, aged 8-14 years old, studying in the 4th-6th grades across four classes in two schools. Using laptops, pupils participated in test lessons where content, text, figures, and exercises were generated and modified using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5, as one example of generative AI, to personify learning material so that it would meet the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. A clear majority of pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI-modified material. There is a promising potential of generative AI use in school education, supporting pupils' motivated learning and skills development. However, these tools need to be developed, refined and optimized to ensure proper adaptation and to create impactful, inclusive, and sustainable learning in schools to benefit pupils, teachers and education managers alike.

AB IntroductionThe use of deep convolutional neural networks for analyzing skin lesion images has shown promising results. The identification of skin cancer by faster and less expensive means can lead to an early diagnosis, saving lives and avoiding treatment costs. However, to implement this technology in a clinical context, it is important for specialists to understand why a certain model makes a prediction; it must be explainable. Explainability techniques can be used to highlight the patterns of interest for a prediction.MethodsOur goal was to test five different techniques: Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, Eigen-CAM, and LIME, to analyze the agreement rate between features highlighted by the visual explanation maps to 3 important clinical criteria for melanoma classification: asymmetry, border irregularity, and color heterogeneity (ABC rule) in 100 melanoma images. Two dermatologists scored the visual maps and the clinical images using a semi-quantitative scale, and the results were compared. They also ranked their preferable techniques.ResultsWe found that the techniques had different agreement rates and acceptance. In the overall analysis, Grad-CAM showed the best total+partial agreement rate (93.6%), followed by LIME (89.8%), Grad-CAM++ (88.0%), Eigen-CAM (86.4%), and Score-CAM (84.6%). Dermatologists ranked their favorite options: Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, followed by Score-CAM, LIME, and Eigen-CAM.DiscussionSaliency maps are one of the few methods that can be used for visual explanations. The evaluation of explainability with humans is ideal to assess the understanding and applicability of these methods. Our results demonstrated that there is a significant agreement between clinical features used by dermatologists to diagnose melanomas and visual explanation techniques, especially Grad-Cam.

AB This narrative review discusses how the safe and effective use of clinical artificial intelligence (AI) prediction tools requires recognition of the importance of human intelligence. Human intelligence, creativity, situational awareness, and professional knowledge, are required for successful implementation. The implementation of clinical AI prediction tools may change the workflow in medical practice resulting in new challenges and safety implications. Human understanding of how a clinical AI prediction tool performs in routine and exceptional situations is fundamental to successful implementation. Physicians must be involved in all aspects of the selection, implementation, and ongoing product monitoring of clinical AI prediction tools.

AB This article presents findings from interviews that were conducted with agriculture and food system researchers to understand their views about what it means to conduct 'responsible' or 'trustworthy' artificial intelligence (AI) research. Findings are organized into four themes: (1) data access and related ethical problems; (2) regulations and their impact on AI food system technology research; (3) barriers to the development and adoption of AI-based food system technologies; and (4) bridges of trust that researchers feel are important in overcoming the barriers they identified. All four themes reveal gray areas and contradictions that make it challenging for academic researchers to earn the trust of farmers and food producers. At the same time, this trust is foundational to research that would contribute to the development of high-quality AI technologies. Factors such as increasing regulations and worsening environmental conditions are stressing agricultural systems and are opening windows of opportunity for technological solutions. However, the dysfunctional process of technology development and adoption revealed in these interviews threatens to close these windows prematurely. Insights from these interviews can support governments and institutions in developing policies that will keep the windows open by helping to bridge divides between interests and supporting the development of technologies that deserve to be called "responsible" or "trustworthy" AI.

AB Solid electrolytes (SEs) are crucial materials to realize highly safe and practical all-solid-state Li+-ion batteries. Here, we performed a large-scale computational SE screening on a chemical space of >10 000 Li-rich inverse-perovskite (ip) compounds with tetragonal and cubic structures by high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) and AI-driven methods. A total of 1413 novel candidate compounds were predicted to be synthesizable based on thermodynamic decomposition energy (E-d) and machine-learned experimental synthesis likelihood (L-s). These compounds were further screened using a Pareto-front approximation set of a multiobjective Bayesian optimization tasks for k = 3 DFT-calculated SE properties (f (k) , with k = 1, 2, and 3): (i) electrochemical window from electronic band gap energy (f (1): E (g)), (ii) chemical stability by reaction with moisture (f( 2): E (h)), and (iii) 400 K bulk Li+-ion conductivity (f (3): ?). As a result, the compound list was reduced down to 24 candidate ip SEs, and examples include Cm Li8O2Cl3Br (E-d = 0, L-s > 0.5, E-g = 4.74 eV, E- h = -33.22 kJ/mol, and ? = 9.0 x 10(-4) S/cm), Amm2 Li8OSCl4 (E (d) = 0.070 eV/atom, L (s )> 0.5, E-g = 4.14 eV, E- h = -40.70 kJ/mol, and ? = 9.2 x 10(-2) S/cm), and Cmcm Li12O3SeClBr3 (E (d) = 0.097 eV/atom, L (s) > 0.5, E (g) = 3.36 eV, E (h) = -86.88 kJ/mol, and ? = 7.8 x 10(-1) S/cm). Possible solid-state synthesis routes for the screened SE candidates were also explored using thermodynamic phase competition analysis and classical nucleation theory reaction barrier. Aside from providing a well-informed list of potentially novel ip-type SEs, our work also reports on an effective calculation methodology for tiered large-scale material screening which, at the same time, incorporates "small data" learning on target property datasets that are computationally expensive to obtain. The generated datasets are expected as well to be of great utility for future data-driven material design efforts.

TI Federated adaptive reweighting for medical image classification
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

DT Article
DE Medical image classification; Federated learning; Deep learning
AB Medical data sharing across institutes is crucial to large-scale multi-center studies and the development of realworld AI applications but suffers from serious privacy issues. A promising solution to address this challenge is federated learning, which typically aggregates a global model from heterogeneous data spread across numerous clients without exchanging data. However, the traditional federated learning algorithm (i.e., FedAvg) merely aggregates the locally distributed models according to the amount of data on each client and lacks the consideration of data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Reweighting (FedAR) algorithm for medical image classification. FedAR employs a flexible re-weighting scheme that can balance adaptively the contributions of the amount of data and the performance of the local model on each client to the weight of that client. Specifically, we allow the amount of local data to contribute more to the weight of each client in the early training stage and let the performance of the local model play a more important role in the late stage. We have evaluated the proposed FedAR algorithm against the locally trained model, globally trained baseline, and two existing federated learning algorithms on the ISIC2018 dataset and Chest X-ray14 dataset under the settings with a variable number of clients. Our results suggest that FedAR is an effective federated learning algorithm that substantially outperforms existing federated learning approaches.

AB Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced technology has seen unprecedented expansion in the recent past. This growth brings with it huge opportunities for the positive transformation of the economy, business, healthcare, and society. However, a critical question is whether, and to what extent, regulatory measures and mechanisms have been implemented to safeguard its design, development, and deployment. This paper offers a scoping exercise that maps the regulatory landscape of AI in healthcare (including health research) in certain African countries.
   Methods: This research is conducted across 12 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. As limited specific AI legislation is found in these African countries, and because AI is informed by ancillary regulatory frameworks, we include data protection, digital health, consumer protection, and intellectual property in our research. A scoping review method was applied with a manual search of digital libraries with search terms customised for each repository consisting of core search terms for the various topics, including, among others, "law," "regulation," "artificial intelligence," "data protection," "intellectual property," and "digital health".
   Results and discussion: Analysis of the data demonstrated that while in the African countries under investigation there is no sui generis AI regulation, recent developments were found in areas that inform AI adoption, including in digital health, data protection, consumer protection, and intellectual property. Our findings highlight the fragmentation of the African AI regulatory landscape and illustrate the importance of continued AI regulatory development to ensure that Africa is well positioned for future AI adoption in health.

AB Background Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) requires a combination of elevated cardiac troponins, and clinical or echocardiographic evidence of coronary ischaemia. Identification of patients with a high likelihood of coronary plaque rupture (Type 1 myocardial infarction [MI]) is crucial as it is these patients for whom coronary intervention has been well-established to provide benefit and reduce subsequent coronary ischemic events. However, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have increasingly identified patients with hs-cTn elevations not due to Type 1 MI where recommendations for ongoing care are currently limited. Understanding the profile and clinical outcomes for these patients may inform the development of an emerging evidence-base. Methods Using two previously published studies (hs-cTnT study n=1,937, RAPID-TnT study n=3,270) and the Fourth Universal Definition of MI, index presentations of patients to South Australian emergency departments with suspected AMI, defined by high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) greater than the upper reference limit (14 ng/L) and without obvious corresponding ischaemia on electrocardiogram (ECG), were classified as either Type 1 MI (T1MI), Type 2 MI (T2MI), acute myocardial injury (AI), or chronic myocardial injury (CI). Patients with non-elevated hs-cTnT (defined as ,14 ng/L) were excluded. Out-comes assessed included death, MI, unstable angina, and non-coronary cardiovascular events within 12 months.Results In total, 1,192 patients comprising 164 (13.8%) T1MI, 173 (14.5%) T2MI/AI, and 855 (71.7%) CI were included. The rate of death or recurrent acute coronary syndrome was greatest in patients with T1MI, but also occurred with moderate frequency in Type 2 MI/AI and CI (T1MI: 32/164 [19.5%]; T2MI/AI: 24/173 [13.1%]; CI:116/885 [13.6%]; p=0.008). Of all the deaths observed, 74% occurred among those with an initial index diagnostic classification of CI. After adjusting for age, gender and baseline comorbidities, the relative hazard ratios for non-coronary cardiovascular readmissions were similar across all groups: Type 2 MI/AI: 1.30 (95% confidence interval 0.99-1.72, p=0.062); CI: 1.10 (95% confidence interval 0.61-2.00, p=0.75).Conclusions Non-T1MI accounted for the majority of patients presenting with elevated hs-cTnT without ischaemia on ECG. Patients with T1MI had the highest rates of death or recurrent AMI; however patients with T2MI/AI and CI experienced a substantial rate of non-coronary cardiovascular re-hospitalisations.

AB A meticulous interpretation of steady -state or unsteady -state relative permeability (Kr) experimental data is required to determine a com-plete set of Kr curves. In this work, different machine learning (ML) models were developed to assist in a faster estimation of these curves from steady -state drainage coreflooding experimental runs. These ML algorithms include gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and deep neural network (DNN) with a main focus on and comparison of the two latter algorithms (XGB and DNN). Based on existing mathematical models, a leading -edge framework was developed where a large database of K-r and capillary pressure (P-c) curves were generated. This database was used to perform thousands of coreflood simulation runs representing oil -water drainage steady -state experiments. The results obtained from these simulation runs, mainly pressure drop along with other conventional core analysis data, were used to estimate analytical Kr curves based on Darcy's law. These analytically estimated Kr curves along with the previously generated Pc curves were fed as features into the ML model. The entire data set was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. The k -fold cross-validation technique was applied to increase the model's accuracy by splitting 80% of the training data into 10 folds. In this manner, for each of the 10 experiments, nine folds were used for training and the remaining fold was used for model validation. Once the model was trained and validated, it was subjected to blind testing on the remaining 20% of the data set. The ML model learns to capture fluid flow behavior inside the core from the training data set. In terms of applicability of these ML models, two sets of experimental data were needed as input; the first was the analytically estimated Kr curves from the steady -state drainage coreflooding experiments, while the other was the P-c curves estimated from centrifuge or mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements. The trained/tested model was then able to estimate Kr curves based on the experimental results fed as input. Furthermore, to test the performance of the ML model when only one set of experimental data is available to an end user, a recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm was trained/tested to predict K-r curves in the absence of P-c curves as an input.The performance of the three developed models (XGB, DNN, and RNN) was assessed using the values of the coefficient of determi-nation (R-2) along with the loss calculated during training/validation of the model. The respective crossplots along with comparisons of ground truth vs. artificial intelligence (AI)-predicted curves indicated that the model is capable of making accurate predictions with an error percentage between 0.2% and 0.6% on history-matching experimental data for all three tested ML techniques. This implies that the AI -based model exhibits better efficiency and reliability in determining Kr curves when compared to conventional methods. The devel-oped ML models by no means replace the need to conduct drainage coreflooding or centrifuge experiments but act as an alternative to existing commercial platforms that are used to interpret experimental data to predict Kr curves. The two main advantages of the developed ML models are their capability of predicting Kr curves within a matter of a few minutes as well as with limited intervention from the end user.
   The results also include a comparison between classical ML approaches, shallow neural networks, and DNNs in terms of accuracy in predicting the final K-r curves. The research presented here is an extension of the state -of -the -art framework proposed by Mathew et al. (2021). However, the two main aspects of the current study are the application of deep learning for the prediction of Kr curves and the application of feature engineering. The latter not only reduces the training/testing time for the ML models but also enables the end user to obtain the final predictions with the least set of experimental data. The various models discussed in this research work currently focus on the prediction of Kr curves for drainage steady -state experiments; however, the work can be extended to capture the imbibition cycle as well.

AB In the field of remote sensing, the classification of land cover is a pivotal and challenging issue. Standard models fail to capture global and semantic information in remote sensing images despite the fact that a convolutional neural network provides robust support for semantic segmentation. In addition, owing to disparities in semantic levels and spatial resolution, the simple fusion of low-level and high-level features may diminish the efficiency. To address these deficiencies, an attention-guided multi-level feature fusion network (AMFFNet) is proposed in this study. The proposed AMFFNet approach is designed as an encoder-decoder network with the inclusion of a multi-level feature fusion module (MFF) and a dual attention map module (DAM). A DAM models the semantic association of features from a spatial and channel perspective, and an MFF bridges the semantic and resolution gaps between high-level and low-level features. Furthermore, we propose a residual-based boundary refinement upsample module to further optimize the object boundaries. The experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy can considerably enhance the accuracy of land cover classification, achieving a mean intersection over union of 90.39% on the LandCover.ai dataset and 63.14% on the Gaofen Image Dataset with 15 categories (GID-15).

ID MORTALITY
AB The high mortality rate of sepsis, especially in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) makes it third-highest mortality disease globally. The treatment of sepsis is also time consuming and depends on multi-parametric tests, hence early identification of patients with sepsis becomes crucial. The recent rise in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models, especially in early prediction of sepsis, have improved the patient outcome. However, drawbacks like low sensitivity, use of excess features that leads to overfitting, and lack of interpretability limit their ability to be used in a clinical setting. So, in this research we have developed a smart, explainable and a highly accurate AI based model (called XAutoNet) that provides quick and early prediction of sepsis with a minimal number of features as input. An application based novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based autoencoder is also implemented that improves the performance of XAutoNet by dimensional reduction. Finally, to unbox the "Black Box" nature of these models, Gradient based Class Activation Map (GradCAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are implemented to provide interpretability of autoencoder and XAutoNet in the form of visualization graphs to assist clinicians in diagnosis and treatment.

AB The Lithium-ion batteries market is rapidly growing. Estimating the batteries State of Charge (SOC) and their State of Health (SOH) is a challenging but crucial task, which Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can manage when trained with appropriate data. Physical measurements such as current, voltage and temperature during battery discharge are conventionally used as inputs of AI algorithms to provide an estimation of SOC. In this work, the effect of the battery impedance measurement on the training of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been studied. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed for in-situ impedance measurements at different frequencies to consider the effects of each perturbation. The obtained complex impedance values along with the measured current, voltage and temperature data, have been evaluated as features of a training set for an SVM in its regression form (SVR). To allow for simultaneous data acquisition, a module composed of 16 battery cells connected in series has undergone a total of 15 discharge cycles. Several SVR models have been trained with a variety of feature combinations, to evaluate the effect of different impedance information on the resulting model. When using the same battery cell for training and testing, the addition of magnitude and phase of the 100 Hz impedance to the input vector decreased the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the estimated SOC from 1.34% to 1.09%. On the other hand, the same SVR model showed an RMSE of 1.23% when using different (but nominally identical) cells for testing.

AB Generative Neural Networks (GNN) have demonstrated remarkable power in creating novel graphic design images from text-to-image training. This work applies GNNs to design dynamic inductive power transfer systems to make charging electrical vehicles (EVs) more convenient and cheaper. Discovering optimal and safe coil implementations (for EV and road) is challenging because of the combinatorial explosion of possible configurations, along with multiple conflicting objective functions, such as maximizing the output power, while minimizing stray magnetic fields and the volume of windings and magnetic cores. To solve the problem, a differentiable simulator and evaluator define loss functions that train a generative neural network to only produce configurations that satisfy eight given design criteria. Before training, the rate of finding successful designs is 0.005%, but within 500 training epochs, the rate becomes 98% (about 30 seconds run time). Solution diversity and quality may be further improved by applying loss functions trained on pairwise Pareto-optimal generated examples.

AB Virtual characters (VCs) play a significant role in the entertainment industry, and AI-driven VCs are being developed to enable interaction with users. People are attracted to these VCs, resulting in a demand for them to co-exist in the same world. An approach to allow recording of the memories with the VCs is to capture videos or photos with them, where users are usually required to adapt their poses to the pre-rendered VC's action. To allow a more seamless collaboration with VCs in photography scenarios, we propose VCPoser, which enables VCs to adapt their pose to the pose of the user. We created a deep neural network-based system that predicts a VC's pose using the user's pose data as input by learning the paired pose data. Our quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our system can predict and generate poses of VCs and allow them to be combined next to the posing user in a photo. We also provide an analysis of the human mindsets of paired poses for a better understanding of them and to share insights for aesthetic pose design.

AB Autostereoscopic displays allow the users to view the 3D content on electronic displays without wearing any glasses. However, the content for glass-free 3D displays needs to be in 3D format such that novel views could be synthesized. Unfortunately, nowadays images/videos are still normally captured in 2D which cannot be directly utilized for glass-free 3D displays. In this paper, we introduce an AI-empowered cloud solution towards end-to-end 2D-to-3D image conversion for autostereoscopic 3D displays, or "CONVAS (3D)" in short. Taking a single 2D image as the input, CONVAS (3D) is able to automatically convert the input 2D image and generate an image suitable for a target autostereoscopic 3D display. It is implemented on a web-based server such that it can allow the users to submit the conversion task and to retrieve the results without geographical constraints.

ID ATTACKS
AB Wireless enabling technologies in critical infrastructures are increasing the efficiency of communications. In the era of 5G and beyond, more technologies will be allowed to connect to mobile networks, enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) on a massive scale. Most of these technologies are vulnerable to physical-layer security attacks, namely jamming. Jamming attacks are among the most effective techniques to attack and compromise the availability of these wireless technologies. Jamming is an interfering signal that limits the intended receiver from correctly receiving the messages. Once the adversary deploys a jammer in a wireless network, jammer detection becomes difficult, if not impossible, due to the inaccessibility of the affected devices in the network. This paper extends the state-of-the-art jamming detection and classification methods by proposing an effective IoT Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)-based approach, where a trained deep learning model is deployed on an IoT edge device, namely a Raspberry Pi. The model is built using TensorFlow and deployed on the IoT device using TensorFlow lite. The trained model encompasses two commonly known jamming types: constant and periodic, in addition to the normal channel state. The Raspberry Pi is connected to a Software Defined Radio (SDR) that continuously senses the WiFi channel and acquires Received Signal Strength (RSS) readings which the TinyML model evaluates to detect the presence of jamming and its type. We release both the procedure and collected dataset for the different types of jamming as open source. Finally, we conducted an extensive testing campaign to test, evaluate, and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TinyML-based detection on the edge scheme.

DE Medical device software; regulation
AB Although the medical device industry operates within a stringent regulatory environment, the growing deployment of connected, intelligent medical devices (CIMDs) in the healthcare sector is challenging these established regulatory frameworks. CIMDs come in a variety of forms, from implantables, to specialist IoMT devices deployed at the point-of-care, to AI-based medical devices, and AI as a medical device (AIaMDs). These devices raise several cybersecurity, data management, and algorithmic integrity concerns for patient safety and the delivery of reliable, responsible healthcare. The purpose of this article is to focus on a particular characteristic of CIMDs: their changing risk profile, several times throughout their lifecycle, with limited awareness from users, manufacturers, and regulators. Looking at the implications of these often subtle yet meaningful software modifications for current medical device regulations and for critical stakeholders in the CIMD ecosystem, the article highlights three main challenges to: i) risk assessment, classification and management frameworks that underpin current medical device regulations; ii) current medical device compliance frameworks, especially the post-market surveillance of medical devices; and iii) the detection, categorization, and reporting of compromised devices that might not perform according to their intended purpose. The article brings empirical evidence from a qualitative research study conducted with critical stakeholders in the medical device sector.

AB We address the problem of estimating the time-to-employment of a jobseeker using survival analysis and oblique predictive clustering tree. Unlike standard survival analysis, oblique predictive clustering tree can handle categorical and continuous data and is capable of modelling non-linear dependences. Treating the censored data as missing data opens the possibility to perform survival analysis by using structured output prediction in semi-supervised multi-target regression setting. The effectiveness of this approach is shown on a real dataset from Public Employment Services in Slovenia, comprising time-to-employment records with jobseekers' personal and professional characteristics. The performances are compared with six state-of-the-art AI methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of using semi-supervised oblique predictive clustering tree for survival analysis.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic wreaks havoc on healthcare systems all across the world. In pandemic scenarios like COVID-19, the applicability of diagnostic modalities is crucial in medical diagnosis, where non-invasive ultrasound imaging has the potential to be a useful biomarker. This research develops a computer-assisted intelligent methodology for ultrasound lung image classification by utilizing a fuzzy pooling-based convolutional neural network FP-CNN with underlying evidence of particular decisions. The fuzzy-pooling method finds better representative features for ultrasound image classification. The FPCNN model categorizes ultrasound images into one of three classes: covid, disease-free (normal), and pneumonia. Explanations of diagnostic decisions are crucial to ensure the fairness of an intelligent system. This research has used Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) to explain the prediction of the FP-CNN models. The prediction of the black-box model is illustrated using the SHAP explanation of the intermediate layers of the black-box model. To determine the most effective model, we have tested different state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures with various training strategies, including fine-tuned models, single-layer fuzzy pooling models, and fuzzy pooling at all pooling layers. Among different architectures, the Xception model with all pooling layers having fuzzy pooling achieves the best classification results of 97.2% accuracy. We hope our proposed method will be helpful for the clinical diagnosis of covid-19 from lung ultrasound (LUS) images.

DE Clinical decision-making; Metastases; Interpretable; Deep learning
AB Purpose: AI modeling physicians' clinical decision-making (CDM) can improve the efficiency and accuracy of clinical practice or serve as a surrogate to provide initial consultations to patients seeking secondary opinions. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI model that predicts dose fractionation for patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases with an interpretation of its decision-making process.Materials/Methods: 152 patients with brain metastases treated by radiosurgery from 2017 to 2021 were obtained. CT images and target and organ-at-risk (OAR) contours were extracted. Eight non-image clinical parameters were also extracted and digitized, including age, the number of brain metastasis, ECOG performance status, presence of symptoms, sequencing with surgery (pre-or post-operative radiation therapy), de novo vs. re-treatment, primary cancer type, and metastasis to other sites. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures with encoding paths were built based on the CT data and clinical parameters to capture three inputs: (1) Tumor size, shape, and location; (2) The spatial relationship between tumors and OARs; (3) The clinical parameters. The models fuse the features extracted from these three inputs at the decision-making level to learn the input independently to predict dose prescription. Models with different independent paths were developed, including models combining two independent paths (IM-2), three independent paths (IM-3), and ten independent paths (IM-10) at the decision-making level. A class activation score and relative weighting were calculated for each input path during the model prediction to represent the role of each input in the decision-making process, providing an interpretation of the model prediction. The actual prescription in the record was used as ground truth for model training. The model performance was assessed by 19-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of randomly selected 128 training, 16 validation, and 8 testing subjects.Result: The dose prescriptions of 152 patient cases included 48 cases with 1 x 24 Gy, 48 cases with 1 x 20-22 Gy, 32 cases with 3 x 9 Gy, and 24 cases with 5 x 6 Gy prescribed by 8 physicians. IM-2 achieved slightly superior performance than IM-3 and IM-10, with 131 (86%) patients classified correctly and 21 (14%) patients misclassified. IM-10 provided the most interpretability with a relative weighting for each input: target (34%), the relationship between target and OAR (35%), ECOG (6%), re-treatment (6%), metastasis to other sites (6%), number of brain metastases (3%), symptomatic (3%), pre/postsurgery (3%), primary cancer type (2%), age (2%), reflecting the importance of the inputs in decision making. The importance ranking of inputs interpreted from the model also matched closely with a physician's own ranking in the decision process.Conclusion: Interpretable CNN models were successfully developed to use CT images and non-image clinical parameters to predict dose prescriptions for brain metastases patients treated by radiosurgery. Models showed high prediction accuracy while providing an interpretation of the decision process, which was validated by the physician. Such interpretability makes the model more transparent, which is crucial for the future clinical adoption of the models in routine practice for CDM assistance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human beings are internally inconsistent in various ways. One way to develop this thought involves using the language of value alignment: the values we hold are not always aligned with our behavior and are not always aligned with each other. Because of this self-misalignment, there is room for potential projects of human enhancement that involve achieving a greater degree of value alignment than we presently have. Relatedly, discussions of AI ethics sometimes focus on what is known as the value alignment problem, the challenge of how to build AI that acts in accordance with our human values. We argue that there is an especially close connection between solving the value alignment problem in AI ethics and using AI to pursue certain forms of human enhancement. But in addition, we also argue that there are important limits to what kinds of human enhancement can be pursued in this way, because some forms of human enhancement-namely moral revolutions-involve a kind of value misalignment rather than alignment.

AB The use of machine learning, or 'artificial intelligence' (AI) in medicine is widespread and growing. In this paper, I focus on a specific proposed clinical application of AI: using models to predict incapacitated patients' treatment preferences. Drawing on results from machine learning, I argue this proposal faces a special moral problem. Machine learning researchers owe us assurance on this front before experimental research can proceed. In my conclusion I connect this concern to broader issues in AI safety.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising generation of digital technologies. Recent applications and research suggest that AI can not only influence but also accelerate innovation in organizations. However, as the field is rapidly growing, a common understanding of the underlying theoretical capabilities has become increasingly vague and fraught with ambiguity. In view of the centrality of innovation capabilities in making innovation happen, we bring together these scattered perspectives in a systematic and multidisciplinary literature review. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the role of AI in influencing innovation capabilities and provide a taxonomy of AI applications based on empirical studies. Drawing on the technological-organizational-environmental (TOE) framework, our review condenses the research findings of 62 studies. The results of our study are twofold. First, we identify a dichotomous view of innovation capabilities triggered by AI adoption: enabling and enhancing. The enabling capabilities are those that research identifies as enablers of AI adoption, underscoring the competencies and routines needed to implement AI. The enhancing capabilities denote the role that AI adoption has in transforming or creating innovation capabilities in organizations. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications that reflects the practical adoption of AI in relation to three underlying reasons: replace, reinforce, and reveal. Our study makes three main contributions. First, we identify the innovation capabilities that are either required for or generated by AI adoption. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications. Third, we use the TOE framework to track trends in the theoretical contributions of recent articles and propose a research agenda.

AB There is growing interest in the field of cooperative artificial intelligence (AI), that is, settings in which humans and machines cooperate. By now, more than 160 studies from various disciplines have reported on how people cooperate with machines in behavioral experiments. Our systematic review of the experimental instructions reveals that the implementation of the machine payoffs and the information participants receive about them differ drastically across these studies. In an online experiment (N = 1,198), we compare how these different payoff implementations shape people's revealed social preferences toward machines. When matched with machine partners, people reveal substantially stronger social preferences and reciprocity when they know that a human beneficiary receives the machine payoffs than when they know that no such "human behind the machine" exists. When participants are not informed about machine payoffs, we found weak social preferences toward machines. Comparing survey answers with those from a follow-up study (N = 150), we conclude that people form their beliefs about machine payoffs in a self-serving way. Thus, our results suggest that the extent to which humans cooperate with machines depends on the implementation and information about the machine's earnings.

AB Electret materials are promising dielectric materials with trapped charges for various applications such as vibration energy harvesters and acoustic transducers. In the present work, ionization potential is discovered as the descriptor to quantify the charging performance for amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using this descriptor, high-throughput computations, and graph neural network models, 1 176 591 functional groups are screened on the cyclic transparent optical polymers (CYTOP), and 3 promising electrets are identified. The electrets are synthesized experimentally as 15 & mu;m-thick films. The films are able to keep their both bipolar surface potentials above & PLUSMN;3.1 kV for over 1500 h and are estimated to have longevity of 146 years under 80 & DEG;C, achieving significant improvements on charging stability among CYTOP-based polymer electrets. The excellent bipolar charging performance can greatly enhance power generation capacity of electret-based vibration energy harvesters. This work also demonstrates the use of deep learning as a new paradigm for accelerating practical materials discovery.
   A new descriptor, solid-state ionization potential, is proposed to quantify the charging performance of amorphous fluorinated polymer electrets. Using the descriptor and a deep-learning-based model, 3 promising molecules are identified out of 1.17 million candidates via high-throughput screening. The 3 new polymers are successfully synthesized and experimentally validated to have excellent charge-trapping performance as electret materials.image

AB Systems of innovation (SI) studies previously considered innovation at different geographical levels and with different foci on actors and processes. However, the boundaries of the SI concepts are becoming blurry and shifting due to technological and economic factors, globalization and interdependence between countries and firms. Previous literature has limitations to address shifting boundaries by assessing SI literature holistically. This study set out to understand the overlaps of SI concepts. It aims at delimiting the SI field, delineating boundaries and at determining the topics underlying the SI and overlaps. Context-specific synergies become transparent, enabling decision-makers and researchers to consider economic interrelationships in a topic-specific and cross-system perspective. The study uses deep learning in combination with natural language processing on data consisting of 2380 SI literature related article abstracts retrieved from Web of Science and EBSCO research databases to capture the semantic context of topics, whereas external information is used to cross-validate interrelationships and to observe topic distribution. The findings reveal significant proportions of overlaps between SI apart from regional and technological systems. Various topics that are discussed within the SI literature such as industrial clusters and structures is a common topic for all SI. This illustrates that economic topics are contextually or theoretically not bound to a system but distributed across the entire literature. We therefore provide a structured framework to illustrate SI overlaps and to address topic synergies. Our study contributes to the body of literature where SI boundaries are investigated specifically to the determination of system overlaps, reasoning of their identical SI characteristics and examination of cross-system thematic synergies.

AB We found previously that ChatGPT-4 could use 50 stream-of-consciousness thoughts to make the latent construct of narrative identity explicit. We now demonstrate this as a tool for interventions by coaches and therapists. Using five narrative identities, ChatGPT-4 recommended actionable strategies and interventions tailored to the narrative identity. Artificial intelligence (AI) can thus support coaches and therapists by crafting personalized approaches drawing on the person's narrative identity. This new assistive tool may help clients achieve greater insight, growth and well-being.

Despite extensive developments, issues of AI fairness in clinical contexts have not been adequately addressed. A fair model is normally expected to perform equally across subgroups defined by sensitive variables (e.g., age, gender/sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, etc.). Various fairness measurements have been developed to detect differences between subgroups as evidence of bias, and bias mitigation methods are designed to reduce the differences detected. This perspective of fairness, however, is misaligned with some key considerations in clinical contexts. The set of sensitive variables used in healthcare applications must be carefully examined for relevance and justified by clear clinical motivations. In addition, clinical AI fairness should closely investigate the ethical implications of fairness measurements (e.g., potential conflicts between group- and individual-level fairness) to select suitable and objective metrics. Generally defining AI fairness as "equality" is not necessarily reasonable in clinical settings, as differences may have clinical justifications and do not indicate biases. Instead, "equity" would be an appropriate objective of clinical AI fairness. Moreover, clinical feedback is essential to developing fair and well-performing AI models, and efforts should be made to actively involve clinicians in the process. The adaptation of AI fairness towards healthcare is not self-evident due to misalignments between technical developments and clinical considerations. Multidisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, clinicians, and ethicists is necessary to bridge the gap and translate AI fairness into real-life benefits.

AB Background: Modern research suggests that the racial influence on smoking and drinking behaviors may not be as prevalent as once thought. This study utilizes national survey data to compare binge drinking and commercial cigarette smoking behaviors between American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) and non-Hispanic Whites in the five most populous AI/AN U.S. states.Methods: Data were analyzed from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2018 to 2022; White (n=79,405), AI/AN (n=11,007). Data analyses include frequency statistics, followed by two model evaluations comparing main effects of race/ethnicity and sex for both binge drinking and commercial cigarette smoking behaviors, and subgroup estimates of race/ethnicity by sex. An ANOVA was utilized to evaluate differences by race/ethnicity, sex, and race/ethnicity by sex subgroups by states.Results: Males were over twice as likely to engage in binge drinking, with no significant differences found between people identifying as AI/AN and White individuals. Both White and AI/AN males were twice as likely to engage in binge drinking, compared to their White female counterparts. AI/AN individuals were over twice as likely to engage in commercial cigarette smoking compared to their White counterparts. Conclusions: Results showed no significance differences in AI/AN versus White individuals in binge drinking (controlling for sex, age, and income), while there were significant differences by sex (controlling for race/ ethnicity, age, and income). People identifying as AI/AN were significantly more likely to engage in commercial cigarette smoking compared to White individuals, signifying the importance of racial/ethnical and covariate considerations when establishing public health interventions.

AB Introduction: Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a rare type of melanoma associated with delayed diagnosis and poor survival rates. This study examines ALM incidence rates in comparison to all other melanoma types. Methods: We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, which together cover 99% of the US population. We calculated age-adjusted rates and rate ratios for ALM and all other malignant melanomas by sex, race and ethnicity, stage, and year of diagnosis (2010-2019). Results: ALM incidence rates were significantly lower among non-Hispanic Black persons (1.8 per 1,000,000); non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API) persons (1.7 per 1,000,000); and Hispanic Black, American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN), and API persons (1.5 per 1,000,000) compared to non-Hispanic White persons (2.3 per 1,000,000). Rates were significantly higher among Hispanic White persons (2.8 per 1,000,000) compared to nonHispanic White persons. For all other melanoma types, incidence rates were significantly higher among nonHispanic White persons compared to persons in each of the other racial and ethnic categories. The percentage of melanomas that were ALM ranged from 0.8% among non-Hispanic White persons to 19.1% among Hispanic Black, AI/AN, and API persons. Conclusion: These findings suggest that awareness of the potential for ALM in patients of all races and ethnicities could be balanced with an understanding of the rarity of the disease and the potential for the development of other melanoma types in racial and ethnic minority groups.

AB Background Accurate analysis of quantitative PET data plays a crucial role in studying small, specific brain structures. The integration of PET and MRI through an integrated PET/MR system presents an opportunity to leverage the benefits of precisely aligned structural MRI and molecular PET images in both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, in many clinical workflows, PET studies are often performed without the aid of individually matched structural MRI scans, primarily for the sake of convenience in the data collection and brain segmentation possesses. Currently, two commonly employed segmentation strategies for brain PET analysis are distinguished: methods with or without MRI registration and methods employing either atlas-based or individual-based algorithms. Moreover, the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted methods for predicting brain segmentation holds promise but requires further validation of their efficiency and accuracy for clinical applications. This study aims to compare and evaluate the correlations, consistencies, and differences among the above-mentioned brain segmentation strategies in quantification of brain metabolism in 18F-FDG PET/MR analysis.
   Results Strong correlations were observed among all methods (r = 0.932 to 0.999, P < 0.001). The variances attributable to subject and brain region were higher than those caused by segmentation methods (P < 0.001). However, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)s between methods with or without MRI registration ranged from 0.924 to 0.975, while ICCs between methods with atlas- or individual-based algorithms ranged from 0.741 to 0.879. Brain regions exhibiting significant standardized uptake values (SUV) differences due to segmentation methods were the basal ganglia nuclei (maximum to 11.50 +/- 4.67%), and various cerebral cortexes in temporal and occipital regions (maximum to 18.03 +/- 5.52%). The AI-based method demonstrated high correlation (r = 0.998 and 0.999, P < 0.001) and ICC (0.998 and 0.997) with FreeSurfer, substantially reducing the time from 8.13 h to 57 s on per subject.
   Conclusions Different segmentation methods may have impact on the calculation of brain metabolism in basal ganglia nuclei and specific cerebral cortexes. The AI-based approach offers improved efficiency and is recommended for its enhanced performance.

AB This research article presents a novel approach to examining the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in sustainable supply chains (SSCs) by applying social network analysis (SNA). In contrast to previous literature that primarily relied on bibliometric analysis, this study investigates the intricate relationships among AI applications in SSCs using SNA. The primary objective is to promote collaborative research and offer valuable insights into influential authors, international co-authorship networks, collaborations among scientific institutions, and research categories identified through keyword analysis. Data were collected from the Web of Science (WOS) database to conduct this research, enabling a comprehensive co-authorship network analysis. This network revealed the collaboration patterns of 1400 authors and identified the most significant authors in this field using centrality measures and the TOPSIS technique. The study also explores institutional co-authorship networks, highlighting India's National Institute of Technology (NIT) as the most active institution. By considering geographical proximity and research specialization, the institutional network was divided into distinct clusters. A keyword analysis and thematic map also shed light on Sustainability and Supply Chain Management themes, revealing their connections with AI methodologies. Based on the thematic map, E-waste, Green supply chain management (GSCM), and Green innovation themes are potential future trends. The analysis of the country network showcased varying levels of development and scientific output, with China leading the field of AI applications in SSC research. Countries were further classified into clusters based on their investment in AI for sustainable supply chains, facilitating knowledge exchange and collaboration. The outcomes of this research contribute significantly to the field by utilizing social network analysis to explore co-authorship networks, leading to a comprehensive understanding of collaborative dynamics and knowledge dissemination. The insights gained from this study can inform decision-making, investments, and strategic collaborations in the domain of AI applications for sustainable supply chains, ultimately driving progress toward sustainability objectives.

AB Purpose - This paper examines the relationship between marketing automation emergence and the marketers' use of heuristics in their decision-making processes. Heuristics play a role for the integration of human decision-making models and automation in augmentation processes, particularly in marketing where automation is widespread.Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzes qualitative data about the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics in decision-making models, and it is based on evidence collected from interviews with twenty-two experienced marketers.Findings - Marketers make extensive use of heuristics to manage their tasks. While the adoption of new automatic marketing tools modify the task environment and field of use of traditional decision-making models, the adoption of heuristics rules with a different scope is essential to defining inputs, interpreting/evaluating outputs and control the marketing automation system.Originality/value - The paper makes a contribution to research on the relationship between marketing automation and decision-making models. In particular, it proposes the results of in-depth interviews with senior decision makers to assess the impact of marketing automation on the scope of heuristics as decision-making models adopted by marketers.

AB BackgroundRecent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) systems have enabled advancements in endoscopy. Deep learning systems, using convolutional neural networks, have allowed for real-time AI-aided detection of polyps with higher sensitivity than the average endoscopist. However, not all endoscopists welcome the advent of AI systems.MethodsWe conducted a survey on the knowledge of AI, perceptions of AI in medicine, and behaviours regarding use of AI-aided colonoscopy, in a single centre 2 months after the implementation of Medtronic's GI Genius in colonoscopy. We obtained a response rate of 66.7% (16/24) amongst consultant-grade endoscopists. Fisher's exact test was used to calculate the significance of correlations.ResultsKnowledge of AI varied widely amongst endoscopists. Most endoscopists were optimistic about AI's capabilities in performing objective administrative and clinical tasks, but reserved about AI providing personalised, empathetic care. 68.8% (n = 11) of endoscopists agreed or strongly agreed that GI Genius should be used as an adjunct in colonoscopy. In analysing the 31.3% (n = 5) of endoscopists who disagreed or were ambivalent about its use, there was no significant correlation with their knowledge or perceptions of AI, but a significant number did not enjoy using the programme (p-value = 0.0128) and did not think it improved the quality of colonoscopy (p-value = 0.033).ConclusionsAcceptance of AI-aided colonoscopy systems is more related to the endoscopist's experience with using the programme, rather than general knowledge or perceptions towards AI. Uptake of such systems will rely greatly on how the device is delivered to the end user.

AB Engineering projects are confronted with many problems resulting from overbreak in tunnel blasting, necessitating the optimization of design parameters to minimize overbreak. In this study, an AI-based model for overbreak prediction and optimization is proposed, aiming to mitigate the hazards associated with overbreak. Firstly, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is integrated with three distinct metaheuristic algorithms, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), respectively. Consequently, the hyperparameters are optimized, and the performance of predictions is enhanced. Meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of a small dataset and enhance the generalization ability of the three developed models, a 5-fold cross-validation is employed. Then, the performance of the different models with five distinct swarm sizes is evaluated via four metrics, including coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and variance accounted for (VAF). Subsequently, by comparing the aforementioned developed models, the optimal prediction model with the highest accuracy can be obtained, which is then used for parameter optimization research. Finally, individual studies are conducted to address the issue of overbreak caused by the adoption of identical blasting parameters due to geological variations, aiming to minimize overbreak in different sections of the tunnel. By comparing the optimization abilities of PSO, WOA, and SSA, the objective of finding the minimum value of overbreak within a short timeframe is achieved. The results indicate that the model developed in this study accurately predicts overbreak, and effectively optimizes blast parameters for different sections of the tunnel.

AB Affectively charged social media exchanges pertaining to remote schooling in Hungary during the early stages of the pandemic provided unique insights into dispositions towards technologically mediated learning. In this article, we explore how parents and teachers responded to the increased porosity, mobility, and visibility of classroom interactions during pandemic-related school closures. We wanted to know what emotive responses to the intensification of digital media use in the home revealed about boundaries of learning in Hungary. Data were gathered with SentiOne(TM)'s(1) AI-based social listening tool and analysed by coupling an attunement to affect with a multimodal analytic. We found a lack of shared understanding of what technologically mediated learning from home entails placed boundaries of learning under threat. To enable shared understandings and strengthen trust between students, teachers, and parents, we propose protected spaces that escape public scrutiny for joint digital practices to evolve.

AB Uncontrolled and fast cell proliferation is the cause of brain tumors. Early cancer detection is vitally important to save many lives. Brain tumors can be divided into several categories depending on the kind, place of origin, pace of development, and stage of progression; as a result, tumor classification is crucial for targeted therapy. Brain tumor segmentation aims to delineate accurately the areas of brain tumors. A specialist with a thorough understanding of brain illnesses is needed to manually identify the proper type of brain tumor. Additionally, processing many images takes time and is tiresome. Therefore, automatic segmentation and classification techniques are required to speed up and enhance the diagnosis of brain tumors. Tumors can be quickly and safely detected by brain scans using imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and others. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in developing algorithms that aid in automatic classification and segmentation utilizing various imaging modalities. The right segmentation method must be used to precisely classify patients with brain tumors to enhance diagnosis and treatment. This review describes multiple types of brain tumors, publicly accessible datasets, enhancement methods, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, machine learning techniques, deep learning, and learning through a transfer to study brain tumors. In this study, we attempted to synthesize brain cancer imaging modalities with automatically computer-assisted methodologies for brain cancer characterization in ML and DL frameworks. Finding the current problems with the engineering methodologies currently in use and predicting a future paradigm are other goals of this article.

ID CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY
AB Recent improvements in low-altitude remote sensors and image processing analysis can be utilised to support archaeological research. Over the last decade, the increased use of remote sensing sensors and their products for archaeological science and cultural heritage studies has been reported in the literature. Therefore, different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to recognise archaeological remains or map environmental changes over time. Recently, more thorough object detection approaches have been adopted by researchers for the automated detection of surface ceramics. In this study, we applied several supervised machine learning classifiers using red-green-blue (RGB) and multispectral high-resolution drone imageries over a simulated archaeological area to evaluate their performance towards semi-automatic surface ceramic detection. The overall results indicated that low-altitude remote sensing sensors and advanced image processing techniques can be innovative in archaeological research. Nevertheless, the study results also pointed out existing research limitations in the detection of surface ceramics, which affect the detection accuracy. The development of a novel, robust methodology aimed to address the "accuracy paradox" of imbalanced data samples for optimising archaeological surface ceramic detection. At the same time, this study attempted to fill a gap in the literature by blending AI methodologies for non-uniformly distributed classes. Indeed, detecting surface ceramics using RGB or multi-spectral drone imageries should be reconsidered as an 'imbalanced data distribution' problem. To address this paradox, novel approaches need to be developed.

AB In the past two decades, research in visual analytics (VA) applications has made tremendous progress, not just in terms of scientific contributions, but also in real-world impact across wide-ranging domains including bioinformatics, urban analytics, and explainable AI. Despite these success stories, questions on the rigor and value of VA application research have emerged as a grand challenge. This article outlines a research and development agenda for making VA application research more rigorous and impactful. We first analyze the characteristics of VA application research and explain how they cause the rigor and value problem. Next, we propose a research ecosystem for improving scientific value, and rigor and outline an agenda with 12 open challenges spanning four areas, including foundation, methodology, application, and community. We encourage discussions, debates, and innovative efforts toward more rigorous and impactful VA research.

AB Throughout the history of medicine, preeclampsia has remained an enigmatic field of obstetrics. In 2023, despite its prevalence and impact, preeclampsia's exact cause and effective treatment remain elusive; the current options are limited to delivery. The purpose of this review is to summarize the knowledge of the possible novel prophylactic therapies and screening methods for preeclampsia, thereby providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers. Aspirin and LMWH have already been widely used; meanwhile, calcium, vitamin D, and pravastatin show promise, and endothelin receptor antagonists are being explored. Stress reduction, dietary changes, and lifestyle modifications are also being investigated. Another interesting and fast-growing area is AI- and software-based screening methods. It is also key to find novel biomarkers, which, in some cases, are not only able to predict the development of the disease, but some of them hold promise to be a potential therapeutic target. We conclude that, while a definitive cure for preeclampsia may not be eligible in the near future, it is likely that the assessment and enhancement of preventive methods will lead to the prevention of many cases. However, it is also important to highlight that more additional research is needed in the future to clarify the exact pathophysiology of preeclampsia and to thus identify potential therapeutic targets for more improved treatment methods.

AB This study aims to discover how artificial intelligence adoption in notion (AI) plays a role in digital innovation using the theoretical foundation of diffusion of innovations and effectuation theories. The current research also investigates the moderating role of other edge Internet of Things (IoT) and the mediating role of adaptive resilience. The data collection is performed using a survey conducted among employees of family-owned SMEs. The findings reveal that AI forecasts digital innovation through adaptive resilience. The results also confirm the moderating role of threat to IoT edge and the mediating role of adaptive resilience, but moderated mediating is not supported. We conclude that family-owned SMEs intend to adopt AI, but SMEs face challenges using IoT edge. This study has implications for family firms specifically and technology adopters in general.

AB Currently, the trend of elderly people living alone is rising due to rapid aging and shifts in family structures. Accordingly, the efficient implementation and management of monitoring systems tailored for elderly people living alone have become paramount. Monitoring systems are generally implemented based on multiple sensors, and the collected data are processed on a server to provide monitoring services to users. Due to the use of multiple sensors and a reliance on servers, there are limitations to economical maintenance and a risk of highly personal information being leaked. In this paper, we propose an intelligent monitoring system with privacy preservation based on edge AI. The proposed system achieves cost competitiveness and ensures high security by blocking communication between the camera module and the server with an edge AI module. Additionally, applying edge computing technology allows for the efficient processing of data traffic. The edge AI module was designed with Verilog HDL and was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Through experiments conducted on 6144 frames, we achieved 95.34% accuracy. Synthesis results in a 180 nm CMOS technology indicated a gate count of 1516 K and a power consumption of 344.44 mW.

AB Hyperspectral satellite missions, such as PRISMA of the Italian Space Agency (ASI), have opened up new research opportunities. Using PRISMA data in land cover classification has yet to be fully explored, and it is the main focus of this paper. Historically, the main purposes of remote sensing have been to identify land cover types, to detect changes, and to determine the vegetation status of forest canopies or agricultural crops. The ability to achieve these goals can be improved by increasing spectral resolution. At the same time, improved AI algorithms open up new classification possibilities. This paper compares three supervised classification techniques for agricultural crop recognition using PRISMA data: random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The study was carried out over an area of 900 km2 in the province of Caserta, Italy. The PRISMA HDF5 file, pre-processed by the ASI at the reflectance level (L2d), was converted to GeoTiff using a custom Python script to facilitate its management in Qgis. The Qgis plugin AVHYAS was used for classification tests. The results show that CNN gives better results in terms of overall accuracy (0.973), K coefficient (0.968), and F1 score (0.842).

AB Background Low birth weight (LBW) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and increases various disease risks across life stages. Prediction models of LBW have been developed before, but have limitations including small sample sizes, absence of genetic factors and no stratification of neonate into preterm and term birth groups. In this study, we challenged the development of early prediction models of LBW based on environmental and genetic factors in preterm and term birth groups, and clarified influential variables for LBW prediction.
   Methods We selected 22,711 neonates, their 21,581 mothers and 8,593 fathers from the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project Birth and Three-Generation cohort study. To establish early prediction models of LBW for preterm birth and term birth groups, we trained AI-based models using genetic and environmental factors of lifestyles. We then clarified influential environmental and genetic factors for predicting LBW in the term and preterm groups.
   Results We identified 2,327 (10.22%) LBW neonates consisting of 1,077 preterm births and 1,248 term births. Our early prediction models archived the area under curve 0.96 and 0.95 for term LBW and preterm LBW models, respectively. We revealed that environmental factors regarding eating habits and genetic features related to fetal growth were influential for predicting LBW in the term LBW model. On the other hand, we identified that genomic features related to toll-like receptor regulations and infection reactions are influential genetic factors for prediction in the preterm LBW model.
   Conclusions We developed precise early prediction models of LBW based on lifestyle factors in the term birth group and genetic factors in the preterm birth group. Because of its accuracy and generalisability, our prediction model could contribute to risk assessment of LBW in the early stage of pregnancy and control LBW risk in the term birth group. Our prediction model could also contribute to precise prediction of LBW based on genetic factors in the preterm birth group. We then identified parental genetic and maternal environmental factors during pregnancy influencing LBW prediction, which are major targets for understanding the LBW to address serious burdens on newborns' health throughout life.

TI Deep learning classification of shoulder fractures on plain radiographs

SO PLOS ONE

ID REPRODUCIBILITY; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB In this study, we present a deep learning model for fracture classification on shoulder radiographs using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The primary aim was to evaluate the classification performance of the CNN for proximal humeral fractures (PHF) based on the AO/OTA classification system. Secondary objectives included evaluating the model's performance for diaphyseal humerus, clavicle, and scapula fractures. The training dataset consisted of 6,172 examinations, including 2-7 radiographs per examination. The overall area under the curve (AUC) for fracture classification was 0.89, indicating good performance. For PHF classification, 12 out of 16 classes achieved an AUC of 0.90 or greater. Additionally, the CNN model had excellent overall AUC for diaphyseal humerus fractures (0.97), clavicle fractures (0.96), and good AUC for scapula fractures (0.87). Despite the limitations of the study, such as the reliance on ground truth labels provided by students with limited radiographic assessment experience, our findings are in concordance with previous studies, further consolidating CNN as potent fracture classifiers in plain radiographs. The inclusion of multiple radiographs with different views from each examination, as well as the generally unselected nature of the sample, contributed to the overall generalizability of the study. This is the fifth study published by our group on AI in orthopaedic radiographs, which has consistently shown promising results. The next challenge for the orthopaedic research community will be to transfer these results from the research setting into clinical practice. External validation of the CNN model should be conducted in the future before it is considered for use in a clinical setting.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) solutions have greatly evolved recently with the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Indeed, AI enriches the IoT with intelligence capabilities. In particular, AI methods are highly effective in the scope of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) for the applications requiring decision support for doctors. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) framework for the classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). In contrast to the state-of-the-art solutions relying on only the saccade test for the classification of these neurodegenerative diseases, we collect a dataset while the subjects perform five exercises including saccade, spontaneous nystagmus, optokinetic nystagmus, pursuit, and gaze test. We then extract the pupil features (coordinates, area, minor axis, and major axis) using the image segmentation DL model and represent them as images using Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) time series imagining algorithm. The resultant images are supplied to the proposed disease-detection model for running the classification procedure. The best classification results were obtained for the optokinetic exercise with the accuracy of 96.9%, 90.8%, and 96.9% for the left, right, and both eyes, respectively.

AB Context: It is not clear how to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based models into diagnostic workflows. Objective: To develop and validate a deep-learning-based AI model (AI-Thyroid) for thyroid cancer diagnosis, and to explore how this improves diagnostic performance.Methods: The system was trained using 19 711 images of 6163 patients in a tertiary hospital (Ajou University Medical Center; AUMC). It was validated using 11 185 images of 4820 patients in 24 hospitals (test set 1) and 4490 images of 2367 patients in AUMC (test set 2). The clinical implications were determined by comparing the findings of six physicians with different levels of experience (group 1: 4 trainees, and group 2: 2 faculty radiologists) before and after AI-Thyroid assistance.Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of AI-Thyroid was 0.939. The AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.922, 87.0%, and 81.5% for test set 1 and 0.938, 89.9%, and 81.6% for test set 2. The AUROCs of AI-Thyroid did not differ significantly according to the prevalence of malignancies (>15.0% vs =15.0%, P = .226). In the simulated scenario, AI-Thyroid assistance changed the AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity from 0.854 to 0.945, from 84.2% to 92.7%, and from 72.9% to 86.6% (all P < .001) in group 1, and from 0.914 to 0.939 (P = .022), from 78.6% to 85.5% (P = .053) and from 91.9% to 92.5% (P = .683) in group 2. The interobserver agreement improved from moderate to substantial in both groups.Conclusion: AI-Thyroid can improve diagnostic performance and interobserver agreement in thyroid cancer diagnosis, especially in less-experienced physicians.

AB Objective:A range of neuropathological changes occur in the brains of individuals with adult Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC), a recessive disorder of cholesterol trafficking that results in accumulation of cholesterol and gangliosides in lysosomes, particularly in neurons. One of the most significant regions of grey matter loss occurs in the thalami, which abut the midline. What is not known is whether these are neurodevelopmental in origin well prior to symptomatic onset. We aimed to examine other markers of midline developmental anomalies in adults with NPC.Method:We examined the size of adhesio interthalamica (AI) and cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) (if present) in nine individuals diagnosed with NPC and nine healthy comparison subjects, matched for age and gender, using a 3T magnetic resonance volumetric sequence and measured the length of the AI and CSP in mm.Results:We found that 5/9 NPC patients and 0/9 controls had a missing AI. AI length was significantly shorter in the patient group. No subject in other group had a large CSP, and CSP length did not differ. Duration of illness showed a trend to a negative correlation with AI length in patients.Conclusions:Our findings suggest that adult NPC patients show some markers of early neurodevelopmental disturbance, matching findings seen in psychotic disorders. The differences in AI, but not CSP, suggest neurodevelopmental change may occur early in gestation rather than post-partum. The relationship with duration of illness suggests that there may be atrophy over time in these structures, consistent with prior analyses of grey matter regions in NPC.

AB ObjectivesThe application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the field of pathology has facilitated the development of digital pathology, hence, making AI-assisted diagnosis possible. Due to the variety of lung cancers and the subjectivity of manual evaluation, invasive non-mucinous lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is difficult to diagnose. We aim to offer a deep learning solution that automatically classifies invasive non-mucinous lung ADC histological subtypes.DesignFor this investigation, 523 whole-slide images (WSIs) were obtained. We divided 376 of the WSIs at random for model training. According to WHO diagnostic criteria, six histological components of invasive non-mucinous lung ADC, comprising lepidic, papillary, acinar, solid, micropapillary and cribriform arrangements, were annotated at the pixel level and employed as the predicting target. We constructed the deep learning model using DeepLab v3, and used 27 WSIs for model validation and the remaining 120 WSIs for testing. The predictions were analysed by senior pathologists.ResultsThe model could accurately predict the predominant subtype and the majority of minor subtypes and has achieved good performance. Except for acinar, the area under the curve of the model was larger than 0.8 for all the subtypes. Meanwhile, the model was able to generate pathological reports. The NDCG scores were greater than 75%. Through the analysis of feature maps and incidents of model misdiagnosis, we discovered that the deep learning model was consistent with the thought process of pathologists and revealed better performance in recognising minor lesions.ConclusionsThe findings of the deep learning model for predicting the major and minor subtypes of invasive non-mucinous lung ADC are favourable. Its appearance and sensitivity to tiny lesions can be of great assistance to pathologists.

AB Neuroscience has long been an essential driver of progress in artificial intelligence (AI). We propose that to accelerate progress in AI, we must invest in fundamental research in NeuroAI. A core component of this is the embodied Turing test, which challenges AI animal models to interact with the sensorimotor world at skill levels akin to their living counterparts. The embodied Turing test shifts the focus from those capabilities like game playing and language that are especially well-developed or uniquely human to those capabilities - inherited from over 500 million years of evolution - that are shared with all animals. Building models that can pass the embodied Turing test will provide a roadmap for the next generation of AI.

AB Kinetic modeling is a challenging aspect of biomass conversion due to its inherent complex reactions. Further, it is difficult to achieve the accuracy of predicting the biomass pyrolysis process at varying experimental conditions, particularly for more complex samples based on kinetic modeling alone. Therefore, this study aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) models [artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT)] to predict biomass thermogravimetric (TG) behaviour, derivative TG (DTG), product (volatile and char) yield, and kinetic triplets. Two oil palm biomass types-empty fruit bunches (EFB) and oil palm shells (OPS) - are used to generate a 72-experiment dataset from a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) at different heating rates (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C min(-1)). The results reveal that each AI model can accurately predict the DTG profile with high coefficients of determination (R-2) in the range of 0.94 and 0.99 and low mean square errors (MSE) between 0.09 and 5.12. The product yield prediction results are not as promising, as indicated by higher MSE values (4.27, 2.79, 6.67). However, the ANN models most capably predicted the activation energies of oil palm biomass pyrolysis (similar to 260 degrees C-360 degrees C at 20 degrees C min(-1)) for both model-free and model-fitting methods, followed by the DT and SVM models.

AB Machine learning algorithms, especially Neural Networks (NNs), are a valuable tool used to approximate non-linear relationships, like the AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF), with considerable accuracy - and achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude when deployed for use. Often in power systems literature, the NNs are trained with a fixed dataset generated prior to the training process. In this paper, we show that adapting the NN training dataset during training can improve the NN performance and substantially reduce its worst-case violations. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and enriches the training dataset with critical datapoints that reduce the worst-case violations and deliver a neural network with improved worst-case performance guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in four test power systems, ranging from 39-buses to 162-buses.

AB Researchers from different market domains have made significant developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabling more advanced automated sensing systems and, thus, eliminating the need for the time-consuming manual analysis of data, which is prone to human errors. However, successful deployment of such systems in real world applications requires careful design and analysis of the proposed models. This work focuses on perception done on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) using multi-task learning. There are multiple challenges when considering such platforms. First of all, they often operate in difficult and dynamic conditions affected by various factors, such as background noises, ego-noise of the motors and occluded views. At the same time, they require high performance local compute, co-designed with optimized software solutions that meet small size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. Therefore, the AI models designed for such systems should not introduce computational and memory overheads to allow for real time processing at the embedded edge. Taking this into account, this work proposes a novel neural network-based system that utilizes ensemble-guided modulations of audio path fused with the infrared (IR) visual embedding using the attention mechanism. The ensemble mechanism doesn't require spawning new ensemble members, but instead operates on FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) activation, making it suitable for resource-constraints embedded edge platforms. The performed experiments show that the proposed network outperforms a single FiLM network by 15% and is more robust to noise.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based models can help in diagnosing COVID-19 from lung CT scans and X-ray images; however, these models require large amounts of data for training and validation. Many researchers studied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for producing synthetic lung CT scans and X-Ray images to improve the performance of AI-based models. It is not well explored how good GAN-based methods performed to generate reliable synthetic data. This work analyzes 43 published studies that reported GANs for synthetic data generation. Many of these studies suffered data bias, lack of reproducibility, and lack of feedback from the radiologists or other domain experts. A common issue in these studies is the unavailability of the source code, hindering reproducibility. The included studies reported rescaling of the input images to train the existing GANs architecture without providing clinical insights on how the rescaling was motivated. Finally, even though GAN-based methods have the potential for data augmentation and improving the training of AI-based models, these methods fall short in terms of their use in clinical practice. This paper highlights research hotspots in countering the data scarcity problem, identifies various issues as well as potentials, and provides recommendations to guide future research. These recommendations might be useful to improve acceptability for the GAN-based approaches for data augmentation as GANs for data augmentation are increasingly becoming popular in the AI and medical imaging research community.

AB Classic computer-generated imagery is produced by modeling 3D scene geometry, the surrounding illumination, and a virtual camera. As a result, rendered images accurately capture the geometry and physics of natural scenes. In contrast, AI-generated imagery is produced by learning the statistical distribution of natural scenes from a large set of real images. Without an explicit 3D model of the world, we wondered how accurately synthesized content captures the 3D geometric and photometric properties of natural scenes. From a diverse set of real, GAN- and diffusion-synthesized faces, we estimate a 3D geometric model of the face, from which we estimate the surrounding 3D photometric environment. We also analyze 2D facial features - eyes and mouth - that have been traditionally difficult to accurately render. Using these models, we provide a quantitative analysis of the 3D and 2D realism of synthesized faces.

AB Advancements in AI-synthesized human voices have created a growing threat of impersonation and disinformation, making it crucial to develop methods to detect synthetic human voices. This study proposes a new approach to identifying synthetic human voices by detecting artifacts of vocoders in audio signals. Most DeepFake audio synthesis models use a neural vocoder, a neural network that generates waveforms from temporal-frequency representations like mel-spectrograms. By identifying neural vocoder processing in audio, we can determine if a sample is synthesized. To detect synthetic human voices, we introduce a multi-task learning framework for a binary-class RawNet2 model that shares the feature extractor with a vocoder identification module. By treating vocoder identification as a pretext task, we constrain the feature extractor to focus on vocoder artifacts and provide discriminative features for the final binary classifier. Our experiments show that the improved RawNet2 model based on vocoder identification achieves high classification performance on the binary task overall. Codes and data can be found at https:// github. com/ csun22/SyntheticVoice-Detection- Vocoder-Artifacts.

AB While Li-ion batteries have proven long lifetimes, an accurate assessment of the battery capacity and its remaining life cannot yet be made using current Battery Management Systems (BMS) devices. Battery sensors used in BMS typically monitor voltage, current and temperature of the battery, in order to predict the state of health (SoH) of the battery. SoH is a measure that indicates the remaining capacity that had been affected by degradation. Information obtained by monitoring voltage, current and temperature are often not sufficient to predict SoH. In this study we captured extra information from interfacial layers of the battery through applying Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and employed a XGBoost-based machine learning approach to train our models. The results show that SoH of batteries can be predicted with 90% accuracy, 95% confidence and 82% reliability. Additionally, it was shown that accuracy could be maintained with little to no change even when the number of features was dramatically reduced and the sample size was minimal, thus making this method very practical for embedded EIS/AI based solutions.

AB In this work, we study how to build socially intelligent robots to assist people in their homes. In particular, we focus on assistance with online goal inference, where robots must simultaneously infer humans' goals and how to help them achieve those goals. Prior assistance methods either lack the adaptivity to adjust helping strategies (i.e., when and how to help) in response to uncertainty about goals or the scalability to conduct fast inference in a large goal space. Our NOPA (Neurally-guided Online Probabilistic Assistance) method addresses both of these challenges. NOPA consists of (1) an online goal inference module combining neural goal proposals with inverse planning and particle filtering for robust inference under uncertainty, and (2) a helping planner that discovers valuable subgoals to help with and is aware of the uncertainty in goal inference. We compare NOPA against multiple baselines in a new embodied AI assistance challenge: Online Watch-And-Help, in which a helper agent needs to simultaneously watch a main agent's action, infer its goal, and help perform a common household task faster in realistic virtual home environments. Experiments show that our helper agent robustly updates its goal inference and adapts its helping plans to the changing level of uncertainty.(1)

AB Embodied agents are expected to perform more complicated tasks in an interactive environment, with the progress of Embodied AI in recent years. Existing embodied tasks including Embodied Referring Expression (ERE) and other QA-form tasks mainly focuses on interaction in term of linguistic instruction. Therefore, enabling the agent to manipulate objects in the environment for exploration actively has become a challenging problem for the community. To solve this problem, We introduce a new embodied task: Remote Embodied Manipulation Question Answering (REMQA) to combine ERE with manipulation tasks. In REMQA task, the agent needs to navigate to a remote position and perform manipulation with the target object to answer the question. We build a benchmark dataset for the REMQA task in AI2-THOR simulator. To this end, a framework with 3D semantic reconstruction and modular network paradigms is proposed. The evaluation of the proposed framework on REMQA dataset is presented to validate its effectiveness.

AB The task of motion forecasting is critical for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) to be able to plan a safe maneuver. Towards this goal, modern approaches reason about the map, the agents' past trajectories and their interactions in order to produce accurate forecasts. The predominant approach has been to encode the map and other agents in the reference frame of each target agent. However, this approach is computationally expensive for multi-agent prediction as inference needs to be run for each agent. To tackle the scaling challenge, the solution thus far has been to encode all agents and the map in a shared coordinate frame (e.g., the SDV frame). However, this is sample inefficient and vulnerable to domain shift (e.g., when the SDV visits uncommon states). In contrast, in this paper, we propose an efficient shared encoding for all agents and the map without sacrificing accuracy or generalization. Towards this goal, we leverage pair-wise relative positional encodings to represent geometric relationships between the agents and the map elements in a heterogeneous spatial graph. This parameterization allows us to be invariant to scene viewpoint, and save online computation by re-using map embeddings computed offline. Our decoder is also viewpoint agnostic, predicting agent goals on the lane graph to enable diverse and context-aware multimodal prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the urban Argoverse 2 benchmark as well as a novel highway dataset.

AB A spatial AI that can perform complex tasks through visual signals and cooperate with humans is highly anticipated. To achieve this, we need a visual SLAM that easily adapts to new scenes without pre-training and generates dense maps for downstream tasks in real-time. None of the previous learning-based and non-learning-based visual SLAMs satisfy all needs due to the intrinsic limitations of their components. In this work, we develop a visual SLAM named Orbeez-SLAM, which successfully collaborates with implicit neural representation and visual odometry to achieve our goals. Moreover, Orbeez-SLAM can work with the monocular camera since it only needs RGB inputs, making it widely applicable to the real world. Results show that our SLAM is up to 800x faster than the strong baseline with superior rendering outcomes. Code link: https://github.com/MarvinChung/Orbeez- SLAM.

AB Despite rapid advancements in the lifelong learning (LL) research, a large body of research mainly focuses on improving the performance in the existing static continual learning (CL) setups. These methods lack the ability to succeed in a rapidly changing dynamic environment, where an AI agent needs to quickly learn new instances in a 'single pass' from the non-i.i.d (also possibly temporally contiguous/coherent) data streams without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. For practical applicability, we propose a novel lifelong learning approach, which is streaming, i.e., a single input sample arrives in each time step. Moreover, the proposed approach is single pass, class-incremental, and is subject to be evaluated at any moment. To address this challenging setup and various evaluation protocols, we propose a Bayesian framework, that enables fast parameter update, given a single training example, and enables any-time inference. We additionally propose an implicit regularizer in the form of snap-shot self-distillation, which effectively minimizes the forgetting further. We further propose an effective method that efficiently selects a subset of samples for online memory rehearsal and employs a new replay buffer management scheme that significantly boosts the overall performance. Our empirical evaluations and ablations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the prior works by large margins.

AB The Multi-Object Navigation (MultiON) task requires a robot to localize an instance (each) of multiple object classes. It is a fundamental task for an assistive robot in a home or a factory. Existing methods for MultiON have viewed this as a direct extension of Object Navigation (ON), the task of localising an instance of one object class, and are pre-sequenced, i.e., the sequence in which the object classes are to be explored is provided in advance. This is a strong limitation in practical applications characterized by dynamic changes. This paper describes a deep reinforcement learning framework for sequence-agnostic MultiON based on an actor-critic architecture and a suitable reward specification. Our framework leverages past experiences and seeks to reward progress toward individual as well as multiple target object classes. We use photo-realistic scenes from the Gibson benchmark dataset in the AI Habitat 3D simulation environment to experimentally show that our method performs better than a pre-sequenced approach and a state of the art ON method extended to MultiON.

AB This paper presents the further developments and preliminary results of a large 3D printing machine based on a 3 d.o.f cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) that is used for an artistic exhibition. The printing material is a powder constituted of glass micro-beads that is deposited on a fixed trajectory so that the resulting structure collapses with time.
   A first exhibition has been held during the summer of 2019 and another one was scheduled to take place during ICRA 2020, that was canceled because of the Covid. The current exhibition has started on 07/09/2022 and will end on 10/14/2019. We describe in this paper the improvements of the current prototype, both on hardware and software, compared to the 2019 and 2020 versions. Between 7/9/2022 and 16/10/2022 the CDPR has run for 126 hours and has traveled on a total distance of 9km. During the period 142 layers have been deposited, representing a mass of 2.56 tons of glass powder.

AB Reconstructing objects from real world data and rendering them at novel views is critical to bringing realism, diversity and scale to simulation for robotics training and testing. In this work, we present NeuSim, a novel approach that estimates accurate geometry and realistic appearance from sparse in-the-wild data captured at distance and at limited viewpoints. Towards this goal, we represent the object surface as a neural signed distance function and leverage both LiDAR and camera sensor data to reconstruct smooth and accurate geometry and normals. We model the object appearance with a robust physics-inspired reflectance representation effective for in-the-wild data. Our experiments show that NeuSim has strong view synthesis performance on challenging scenarios with sparse training views. Furthermore, we showcase composing NeuSim assets into a virtual world and generating realistic multi-sensor data for evaluating self-driving perception models.

AB The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in a surge of metasurface design for various purposes. Our latest work [1] has introduced the lateral hybrid system for the first time, where resonators composed of two different materials are placed horizontally next to each other to form a lattice. Such design demonstrates a sensitivity that is five times greater than conventional tunable metasurfaces. With this work, we have successfully implemented an AI-assisted design process to develop an optimized lateral hybrid metasurface for structural colour applications. Our results have demonstrated that the lateral hybrid concept can enhance the performance and optical tuning of various semiconductor and high dielectric metasurfaces, such as TiO2 and Si3N4. This approach has the potential to unlock new opportunities for using metamaterials in high precision sensors with increased sensitivity, and represents a major step forward for the field.

AB With societies growing more and more conscious of human social biases that are implicit in most of our interactions, the development of automated robot social behavior is failing to address these issues as more than just an afterthought. In the present work, we describe how we unintentionally implemented robot listener behavior that was biased toward the gender of the participants, while following typical design procedures in the field. In a post-hoc analysis of data collected in a between-subject user study (n=60), we find that both a rule-based and a deep learning-based listener behavior models produced a higher number of backchannels (listener feedback, through nodding or vocal utterances) if the participant identified as a male. We investigate the cause of this bias in both models and discuss the implications of our findings. Further, we provide approaches that may be taken to address the issue of algorithmic fairness, and preventative measures to avoid the development of biased social robot behavior.

AB Design fixation, a phenomenon describing designers' adherence to pre-existing ideas or concepts that constrain design outcomes, is particularly prevalent in human-robot interaction (HRI), for example, due to collectively held and stabilised imaginations of what a robot should look like or behave. In this paper, we explore the contribution of creative AI tools to overcome design fixation and enhance creative processes in HRI design. In a four weeks long design exploration, we used generative text-to-image models to ideate and visualise robotic artefacts and robot sociotechnical imaginaries. We exchanged results along with reflections through a digital postcard format. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach to imagining novel robot concepts, surfacing existing assumptions and robot stereotypes, and situating robotic artefacts in context. We discuss the contribution to designerly HRI practices and conclude with lessons learnt for using creative AI tools as an emerging design practice in HRI research and beyond.

AB There have been discussions on using robots to provide suggestions for decision making in mixed jury-systems. Hence, it is vital to investigate the influence of system interventions on decision making. This study focused on how such suggestions from a robot and an expert human influenced the decision making of a sentence in a court judgment task. We hypothesized that the sequential pattern of presentation of suggestions by an AI system installed in a robot and a human expert would influence decision making performance. In a large-scale online experiment, we investigated several factors, such as the (a) adviser type (AI(Robot) or Human), (b) sequential order (AI to Human, Human to AI), and (c) length of the sentence (3 or 7 years) that would influence decision making. The results showed that when presented with a human expert's suggestion, after an AI decision, participants were more biased towards the human's suggestion. Moreover, participants' decisions were influenced by the length of the suggestion, especially when presented with heavy lengths (seven years). This provides new implications on the factors that may influence decision making using robots as tools in a mixed jury-system and contributes to the notion of using robots in courts.

AB The increasing number of public AI-art generation tools has allowed people, including children, to be creative and bring their ideas to life. However, these AI systems could be misused by children and expose them to age-inappropriate images. In this paper, we explore how social robots could guide children as an embodied element of the AI art generation system. To investigate this topic, we examined how children conceptualize AI, observed how they use an AI-art generation system called DALL-E 2, and conducted co-design workshops to develop a social robot prototype, Cat-E. The Cat-E aims to help children generate AI art in a regulated, safe but creative way by providing prompts and leading them to generate more ethical and morally sound AI art. This study reveals that children perceive a robot as an embodied element of AI and consider it to be a reliable and unbiased source of information. We propose that social robots can play a role of a friendly guide that enables children creatively but safely utilize AI systems.

ID DISTRESS; PAIN
AB We are developing a social robot to help children cope with painful and distressing medical procedures in the hospital emergency department. This is a domain where a range of interventions have proven effective at reducing pain and distress, including social robots; however, until now, the robots have been designed with limited stakeholder involvement and have shown limited autonomy. For our system, we have defined and validated the necessary robot behaviour together with children, parents/caregivers, and healthcare professionals, taking into account the ethical and social implications of robotics and AI in the paediatric healthcare context. The result of the co-design process has been captured in a flowchart, which has been converted into a set of concrete design guidelines for the AI-based autonomous robot system.

DE Value Alignment; Transparency; Explainable AI
AB As robots become increasingly prevalent in our communities, aligning the values motivating their behavior with human values is critical. However, it is often difficult or impossible for humans, both expert and non-expert, to enumerate values comprehensively, accurately, and in forms that are readily usable for robot planning. Misspecification can lead to undesired, inefficient, or even dangerous behavior. In the value alignment problem, humans and robots work together to optimize human objectives, which are often represented as reward functions and which the robot can infer by observing human actions. In existing alignment approaches, no explicit feedback about this inference process is provided to the human. In this paper, we introduce an exploratory framework to address this problem, which we call Transparent Value Alignment (TVA). TVA suggests that techniques from explainable AI (XAI) be explicitly applied to provide humans with information about the robot's beliefs throughout learning, enabling efficient and effective human feedback.

ID AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; INCLUSION
AB Citizens and policy institutions increasingly express their concerns regarding the emerging challenges in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and have concrete demands for the protection of human rights. In parallel, studies in the field of AI and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) indicate the impact of social robots on children's development. We conducted a systematic review based on UNICEF's AI Policy Guidance to map the landscape of research on social robots and children's rights. We used the PRISMA method and identified. N = 37 papers that address one of the rights, which we then annotated to indicate tendencies and areas of alignment and misalignment with the UNICEF guidance. Our findings reveal that although the field of HRI is looking at specific rights, with a focus on inclusion, some of the rights have been under-researched. Furthermore, we observed a misalignment between HRI and UNICEF regarding the terminology. With this paper, we hope to bring awareness to the field of HRI regarding children's rights and to highlight directions for alignment among research, societal needs, and policy.

DE Human-Robot Interaction; Explainable AI; Reward Design
AB Human-robot interaction is limited by the challenge of writing specifications for robots. We desire alignment between humans' goals and robot behaviors, but this alignment is very hard to achieve [1, 8]. My research tackles this problem. I first study how humans currently write reward functions, and I profile common errors they make when doing so [2]. I then study how humans can inspect robot's learned behaviors. To do so, I introduce a Bayesian inference method for finding behavior examples which cover informationrich test cases [4, 12]. I also study how these examples should be presented to the human through applying human concept learning theories [10, 5, 3]. For the remainder of my thesis, I am studying two questions. First, how these components can be combined such that humans are able to iteratively design better behavioral specifications? Second, can robots smartly interpret humans' erroneous specifications, to correct for these errors?

AB Melodica is a situated robot we envision will help users practise mindfulness and overcome social disconnection through music. At a time when there are insufficient mental health resources, several AI tools have been designed to support people. Whereas these employ therapeutic practice, Melodica uses music as an approach to self-care. Music is a universal language, accessible to everyone, and helps to connect people from different cultures, age groups, and socio-economic backgrounds. Melodica is designed to be an inclusive and affordable robot that aims to accompany users and enrich their musical experiences, bringing people joy and solace to their everyday lives.

AB Dependency on electricity is currently at an all-time high with power distribution being a key element. Currently, the maintenance and monitoring methodologies especially in Pakistan revolve around taking on-field samples (DGA) which is overall primitive and prone to human error. This research paper presents a smart device that can monitor transformer's health using AI and relay that health score to a remote dashboard through the Internet of Things (IoT). The device uses a combination of single board computer, embedded systems, and communication protocols and is designed to detect and diagnose any issues with the transformer and alert the user in real time. The results of this research show that the device is an effective and reliable tool for extrusive monitoring of health of transformer.

AB Rerun is a software system to support post-facto analysis in simulation research. In this submission, we show it working inside a multiplayer driving simulator. Rerun is built in Unity 3D and captures the virtual behavior of participants and their interactions with virtual objects. These recorded behaviors can then be played back from any perspective in the virtual space. This is useful in multi-agent interaction studies because researchers can sift through scenarios carefully from each participant's perspective or even from an outside observer's perspective. This enables a fine-grained understanding of implicit and explicit signaling between participants and other human or AI-controlled agents.

DE Diversity; Inclusion; Equity; HRI; Accessibility; Sampling bias
AB Diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) are critical factors that need to be considered when developing AI and robotic technologies for people. The lack of such considerations exacerbates and can also perpetuate existing forms of discrimination and biases in society for years to come. Although concerns have already been voiced around the globe, there is an urgent need to take action within the human-robot interaction (HRI) community. This workshop contributes to filling the gap by providing a platform in which to share experiences and research insights on identifying, addressing, and integrating DEI considerations in HRI. With respect to last year, this year the workshop will further engage participants on the problem of sampling biases through hands-on co-design activities for mitigating inequity and exclusion within the field of HRI.

AB This work presents an argument for the use of specific documentation for the ethical development, use, and sharing of energy datasets, and an evaluation of current practice in the energy AI community. Drawing on a recently developed resource from the broader machine learning community and applying it to the specific context of energy AI research, opportunities for more transparent collection and distribution of energy datasets are revealed. To help elucidate the utility of the datasheets and the energy community's current level of documentation, two publicly available energy datasets are chosen for analysis. One has published documentation covering 66% of the datasheet questionnaire, while the second covers 42% of the suggested information. Two additional questions are recommended for energy-relevant datasheets that will promote ethical AI practices in the energy domain. A new resource for exploring and aligning energy datasets with demographic data is provided.

The FL paradigm involves different entities (institutions) holding proprietary datasets that, contributing with each other to train a global Artificial Intelligence (AI) model using their own locally available data. Although several studies have proposed methods to distribute the computation or aggregate results, few efforts have been made to cover on how to implement FL pipelines. With the aim of accelerating the exploitation of FL frameworks, this paper proposes a survey of public tools that are currently available for building FL pipelines, an objective ranking based on the current state of user preferences, and an assessment of the growing trend of the tool's popularity over a one year time window, with measurements performed every six months. These measurements include objective metrics, like the number of "Watch," "Star" and "Follow" available from software repositories as well as thirteen custom metrics grouped into three main categories: Usability, Portability, and Flexibility. Finally, a ranking of the maturity of the tools is derived based on the key aspects to consider when building a FL pipeline.

AB Point cloud semantic segmentation predicts the semantic class of each point, which can help AI machines perceive the real 3-D world. Recently, precision for large-scale point cloud is limited by complex scenarios, data occlusion, and massive data, which remains. This letter proposes neural radiance field convolution (NeRFConv) for large-scale point cloud semantic analysis. First, to conquer some existing methods represent the point cloud local space as the relative position without considering the rotation property of the point cloud. A new spatial direction representation called neural radiance field 7-D is constructed to denote the local point cloud space, which is unaffected by the rotation of the coordinate axes. Then, to be robust against the varying density of the point cloud, an adaptive convolution method is proposed to aggregate the local point cloud features and obtain more expressive local features. Finally, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the test dataset. In particular, mIoU of 58.1% and 58.3% were achieved the SensatUrban and SementicKITTI datasets, respectively.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Using huge pages has become a mainstream method to reduce address translation overhead for big memory workloads in modern computer systems. To create huge pages, system software usually uses page coalescing methods to dynamically combine contiguous base pages. Though page coalescing methods help effectively reduce address translation overhead on native systems, as the paper shows, their effectiveness is substantially undermined on virtualized platforms.
   The paper identifies this problem and analyzes the causes. It reveals and experimentally confirms that only huge guest pages backed by huge host pages can effectively reduce address translation overhead. Existing page coalescing methods only aim to increase huge pages at each layer, and fail to consider this cross-layer requirement on the alignmentment of huge pages.
   To address this issue, the paper designs Gemini as a cross-layer solution that guides the formation and allocation of huge pages in the guest and the host. With Gemini, the memory management at one layer is aware of the huge pages at the other layer, and manages carefully the memory regions corresponding to these huge pages. This is to increase the potential of forming and allocating huge pages from these regions and minimize the associated cost. Then, it guides page coalescing and huge page allocation to first consider these regions before other memory regions. Because huge pages are preferentially formed and allocated from these regions and less from other regions, huge guest pages backed by huge host pages can be increased without aggravating the adverse effects incurred by excessive huge pages.
   Extensive evaluation based on the prototype implementation in Linux/KVM and diverse real-world applications, such as key-value store, web server, and AI workloads, shows that Gemini can reduce TLB misses by up to 83% and improve application performance by up to 126%, compared to state-of-the-art page coalescing methods.

DE Distributed file system; Metadata management
AB There is a fundamental tension between metadata scalability and POSIX semantics within distributed file systems. The bottleneck lies in the coordination, mainly locking, used for ensuring strong metadata consistency, namely, atomicity and isolation. CFS is a scalable, fully POSIX-compliant distributed file system that eliminates the metadata management bottleneck via pruning the scope of critical sections for reduced locking overhead. First, CFS adopts a tiered metadata organization to scale file attributes and the remaining namespace hierarchies independently with appropriate partitioning and indexing methods, eliminating cross-shard distributed coordination. Second, it further scales up the single metadata shard performance by single-shard atomic primitives, shortening the metadata requests' lifespan and removing spurious conflicts. Third, CFS drops the metadata proxy layer but employs the light-weight, scalable client-side metadata resolving. CFS has been running in the production environment of Baidu AI Cloud for three years. Our evaluation with a 50-node cluster and microbenchmarks shows that CFS simultaneously improves the throughput of baselines like HopsFS and InfiniFS by 1.76-75.82x and 1.22-4.10x, and reduces their average latency by up to 91.71% and 54.54%, respectively. Under cases with higher contention and larger directories, CFS' throughput benefits expand by one order of magnitude. For three real-world workloads with data accesses, CFS introduces 1.62-2.55x end-to-end throughput speedups and 35.06-62.47% tail latency reductions over InfiniFS.

AB Introduction: We wanted to analyze the trend of publications in a period of 30 years from 1994 to 2023, on the application of 'artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), virtual reality (VR), and radiomics in percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)'. We conducted this study by looking at published papers associated with AI and PCNL procedures, including simulation training, with preoperative and intraoperative applications.
   Materials and Methods: Although MeSH terms research on the PubMed database, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature from 1994 to 2023 for all published papers on 'AI, ML, VR, and radiomics' in 'PCNL', with papers in all languages included. Papers were divided into three 10-year periods: Period 1 (1994-2003), Period 2 (2004-2013), and Period 3 (2014-2023).
   Results: Over a 30-year timeframe, 143 papers have been published on the subject with 116 (81%) published in the last decade, with a relative increase from Period 2 to Period 3 of +427% (p = 0.0027). There was a gradual increase in areas such as automated diagnosis of larger stones, automated intraoperative needle targeting, and VR simulators in surgical planning and training. This increase was most marked in Period 3 with automated targeting with 52 papers (45%), followed by the application of AI, ML, and radiomics in predicting operative outcomes (22%, n = 26) and VR for simulation (18%, n = 21). Papers on technological innovations in PCNL (n = 9), intelligent construction of personalized protocols (n = 6), and automated diagnosis (n = 2) accounted for 15% of publications. A rise in automated targeting for PCNL and PCNL training between Period 2 and Period 3 was +247% (p = 0.0055) and +200% (p = 0.0161), respectively.
   Conclusion: An interest in the application of AI in PCNL procedures has increased in the last 30 years, and a steep rise has been witnessed in the last 10 years. As new technologies are developed, their application in devices for training and automated systems for precise renal puncture and outcome prediction seems to play a leading role in modern-day AI-based publication trends on PCNL.

   Artificial Intelligence
AB Recently, the concept of autonomous driving became prevalent in the domain of intelligent transportation due to the promises of increased safety, traffic efficiency, fuel economy and reduced travel time. Numerous studies have been conducted in this area to help newcomer vehicles plan their trajectory and velocity. However, most of these proposals only consider trajectory planning using conjunction with a limited data set (i.e., metropolis areas, highways, and residential areas) or assume fully connected and automated vehicle environment. Moreover, these approaches are not explainable and lack trust regarding the contributions of the participating vehicles. To tackle these problems, we design an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning model to improve the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the trajectory decisions for newcomer Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). When a newcomer AV seeks help for trajectory planning, the edge server launches a federated learning process to train the trajectory and velocity prediction model in a distributed collaborative fashion among participating AVs. One essential challenge in this approach is AVs selection, i.e., how to select the appropriate AVs that should participate in the federated learning process. For this purpose, XAI is first used to compute the contribution of each feature contributed by each vehicle to the overall solution. This helps us compute the trust value for each AV in the model. Then, a trust-based deep reinforcement learning model is put forward to make the selection decisions. Experiments using a real-life dataset show that our solution achieves better performance than benchmark solutions (i.e., Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Random Selection (RS)).

AB We are now in the early stage of the Fifth Generation (5G) commercialization, and its improved capabilities and unique features will revolutionize the present wireless network. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently working on the 5G New Radio, also known as the worldwide standardization of 5G, which can operate across a wide variety of frequency bands from minus than 6GHz to mmWave (100GHz). Nonetheless, 5G will not be able to satisfy all requirements for the foreseeable future. Hence, Beyond 5G (B5G) and Sixth Generation (6G) have emerged as concepts representing Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs). B5G and 6G networks will probably integrate Artificial intelligence-based services, tactile services, hybrid access, quantum computing, edge computing, and optical wireless communication. This paper describes potential background concepts relating to Network Slicing and artificial intelligence. We present the literature review by studying the impact of Artificial Intelligence with its promising methods, training models, and architectures to be integrated into B5G Network slicing to perform Resource Management.

AB The popularity of home automation has been rapidly increasing in recent years due to higher affordability and simplicity. Today, IoT platforms are vertically oriented and often still closed systems. To enable interoperable interaction with those platforms, we present a home automation system based on open standards enabling IoT peer-to-peer communications. The multiple platforms in multiple IoT applications have been connected using this system. The idea is to enable an open ecosystem by considering standardized communication interfaces to allow real-time data exchanges across platforms and systems. In this work, we perform smart home prototyping and enable device interaction for data sharing and real-time accessibility using any device.

AB Severe pandemics like COVID-19 could cause persistent cough, muscular pains, sinus infections, and severe to serious respiratory diseases, according to a number of recent studies. The symptoms of such kind of illness show that COVID-19 has a harmful impact on the lungs. By applying CT scans and X-ray of the chest to assess the conditions of the lungs can considerably help in the diagnosis of COVID-19. So far, there are numerous techniques for identifying the coronavirus illness, but most of them take a very long time to check and may result in inaccurate outcomes. This research work aims to evaluate and administer image-based diagnosis procedures using artificial intelligence (AI) that have zero or near zero false-positive and false-negative rates. For this study, we will use artificial neural networks (ANN), ensemble learning (EL) and machine learning (ML) approaches in addition to the established AI image-based medical diagnosis procedures to develop a faster, real-time and efficient methodology for better detection and diagnosis of COVID-19.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) empowered with artificial intelligence (AI) have become a new paradigm for marine monitoring and disaster rescue. In AI-enabled UAV applications, UAVs generate amounts of computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, and path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs in time. How to offload the computation-intensive tasks of UAVs timely and effectively has become an urgent challenge. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative computation offloading scheme with UAVs and USV fleets in maritime communication networks. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading, and USV fleets are the assistants. Then, to minimize the overall execution time of computation tasks, UAVs determine the optimal ratio of computation tasks offloaded to USV fleets in the worst case. Afterwards, the first sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the overall execution time and improves the expected revenue of the USV fleet as compared to conventional schemes.

AB With the forthcoming of 5G networks, the underlying infrastructure needs to support a higher number of heterogeneous services with different QoS needs than ever. For that reason, 5G inherently provides a way to allocate these services over the same infrastructure through the concept of Network Slicing. However, to maximize revenue and reduce operational costs, a method to proactively adapt the resources assigned to each slice becomes imperative. For that reason, this work presents two Machine Learning (ML) models, leveraging Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest algorithms, to forecast the throughput of each slice and adapt accordingly the amount of resources needed. The models are evaluated using NS-3, which has been integrated with the ML models through a shared memory framework. This enables a closed loop in which the predictions of the models can be used at run time to introduce changes in the network. Consequently, it makes it able to cope with the forecasted requirements, eliminating the need for off-line training and resembling better a real-life scenario. The evaluation performed shows the ability of the models to predict the slices' throughput under various settings and proves that Random Forest provides up to 26% better results than LSTM.

AB The 5th generation of mobile communication will support three application scenarios of eMBB, uRLLC and mMTC. To meet the requirements, wireless communication systems needs to continue to develop, with the development of artificial intelligence(AI). Machine learning (ML) is expected to optimize wireless systems by tackling complex problems which cannot be solved using traditional mathematical models. AI/ML techniques, which could extract features from raw data in the wireless access network and predict the future state by the previous features, are useful to network optimization. In this paper, indicative use cases using AI/ML techniques in conjunction with its benefits, and its potential deployment solutions are introduced. Furthermore, this paper provides the consideration on the potential prototype of future wireless communication system.

AB For the success of digital applications, especially AI applications, it is essential that both developers and medical professionals are enabled to understand each other's perspective. For this reason, a new concept for an interdisciplinary complex practical course was developed for the master's program in computer science at a German university, based on online learning nuggets and a hackathon on site. The core of the concept is a real-world medical application task: extracting ECG patient data from a smartwatch to support primary care physicians in making decisions regarding an action. The concept was developed based on the so-called constructive alignment concept. An initial application of the concept showed that it was rated as very positive in terms of learning experience and working atmosphere.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic's profound impact on global health and the economy underscores the need for new computational strategies to rapidly identify potential antiviral drugs against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. AI-based drug repurposing methods have the potential to significantly shorten the drug discovery process, rendering them a crucial and efficacious approach for screening anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. In this paper, we proposed GINCM-DTA, an AI-based graph isomorphism network with protein contact map representation for drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction, and presented the COVID-DTA dataset for SARS-CoV-2-specific drug repurposing. Pre-training GINCM-DTA on large-scale Davis and KIBA datasets achieved state-of-the-art performance, while fine-tuning on the COVID-DTA dataset using transfer learning resulted in a mean square error of 0.026 and concordance index of 0.967. Utilizing the fine-tuned GINCM-DTA model, we predicted DTAs for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 main targets, focusing on key conserved proteins and unmutated spike proteins for virtual screening. We integrated GINCM-DTA predictions with molecular docking simulations to identify five candidates. In vitro assays revealed Hydralazine (5.737 nM) as a potential inhibitor of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, effectively blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the results highlight the potential of Hydralazine as a broad-spectrum drug candidate, demonstrating its efficacy in obstructing the binding between ACE2 and spike proteins of multiple Omicron variants, including the currently dominant strains BQ.1, BQ.1.1, XBB.1.5, and XBB.1.16. Our method offers a novel computational strategy for COVID-19 antiviral screening and prepares for potential future epidemics incited by emerging viruses.

AB Computer-aided diagnosis for low-dose computed tomography (CT) based on deep learning has recently attracted attention as a first-line automatic testing tool because of its high accuracy and low radiation exposure. We propose a method based on a deep neural network for computer-aided diagnosis called virtual multi-view projection and reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection (VMPR-UAD) in low-dose chest CT. Presumably, this is the novel method that only requires data from healthy patients for training to identify three-dimensional (3D) regions containing any anomalies. The method has three key components. Unlike existing computer-aided diagnosis tools that use conventional CT slices as the network input, our method (1) improves the recognition of 3D lung structures by virtually projecting an extracted 3D lung region to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images from diverse views to serve as network inputs, (2) accommodates the input diversity gain for accurate anomaly detection, and (3) achieves 3D anomaly/disease localization through a novel 3D map restoration method using multiple 2D anomaly maps. The proposed method based on unsupervised learning showed a high performance in pneumonia, tuberculosis, and both diseases with patient-level anomaly detection performance of 0.965 area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval (CI); (0.955, 0.972)), 0.948 AUC (95% CI; (0.928, 0.966)), and 0.963 AUC (95% CI; (0.955, 0.970)), respectively. Additionally, our technology visualizes anomalous regions in the 3D perspective. This achieved 93% accuracy in visualizing the location of lung cancer lesions through external validation. These results highlight the potential of a new AI methodology without utilizing disease data learning; this can secure AI model prediction stability by reducing the false negative rate that occurs in various patterns of diseases.

AB Objectives: Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy has emerged as a promising noninvasive solution for tumor ablation. Accurate monitoring and guidance of ultrasound energy is crucial for effective FUS treatment. Although ultrasound (US) imaging is a well-suited modality for FUS monitoring, US-guided FUS (USgFUS) faces challenges in achieving precise monitoring, leading to unpredictable ablation shapes and a lack of quantitative monitoring. The demand for precise FUS monitoring heightens when complete tumor ablation involves controlling multiple sonication procedures.Methods: To address these challenges, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted USgFUS framework, incorporating an AI segmentation model with B-mode ultrasound imaging. This method labels the ablated regions distinguished by the hyperechogenicity effect, potentially bolstering FUS guidance. We evaluated our proposed method using the Swin-Unet AI architecture, conducting experiments with a USgFUS setup on chicken breast tissue.Results: Our results showed a 93% accuracy in identifying ablated areas marked by the hyperechogenicity effect in B-mode imaging.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that AI-assisted ultrasound monitoring can significantly improve the precision and control of FUS treatments, suggesting a crucial advancement toward the development of more effective FUS treatment strategies.

   Implementation
AB The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common and inexpensive diagnostic modality available at scale. The ECG reflects electrical activity throughout the cardiac cycle and is increasingly recognized to contain rich signal relevant across the spectrum of human conditions. Recent work has demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI)based algorithms may be able to extract latent information from within the 12-lead ECG to classify the presence of disease and even predict the development of future disease. Despite recent development of many AI-based ECG algorithms, comparably few are used in routine clinical practice. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to identify and mitigate potential barriers to the real-world clinical implementation of AI algorithms. We propose that the adoption of the AI-enabled ECG may be increased by future efforts focused on three key principles: a) maximizing credibility, b) optimizing practicality, and c) establishing clinical utility. In this mini-review, we discuss recent notable work focused on these principles and provide suggestions for future directions. AI-enabled ECG analysis possesses substantial potential to transform current methods to prevent, diagnose, and treat human disease, but a greater emphasis on their real-world application is required to bring that potential to reality.

AB The subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) known as machine learning promises to advanced science and technology by enabling better quality, performance, and predictive capabilities. In this research, a new method was proposed to extend the application of AI to optimize the green synthesis of copper-gallic acid metal-organic framework (CuGA MOF) and explore the complex hyperdimensional relationship between the synthesis parameters and the resulting product qualities. The deep learning (DL) method has shown higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.881. Various synthesis conditions, including the molar ratio of NaOH to GA, temperature, and reaction time, were conducted to obtain the optimal yield and crystallinity percentage. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm suggests inputs of 1.8, 108 ?, and 1.5 h for parameters of the molar ratio of NaOH to GA, temperature, and reaction time, respectively. The optimum results indicate a yield percentage of 60.61 % and a crystallinity percentage of 59.2 %. Furthermore, CuGA MOF was used for basic red 9 (BR9) dye removal from aqueous solutions. The adsorption capacity of this MOF for the removal of BR9 was high, up to 115.08 mg/g. The performance of CuGA 90-2.2 remained high (>90 %) even after 3 adsorption-desorption cycles, making it a promising reusable adsorbent. In addition, the pre-adsorption and post-adsorption of CuGA MOF were characterized by various analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, SEM, EDS, and XPS.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, the most representative deep learning has been applied to various fields, which is greatly influencing human society. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are still a black-box model, and the process how they make decisions internally is still difficult to understand and control. At the same time, DNNs take up more hardware resources, resulting in high energy consumption. Therefore, it is significant to study the characteristics of deep AI models and deeply understand the interactions between parameters within AI models so as to improve the interpretability of DNNs, optimize their structure and increase their computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a graph-based interpretability method for deep neural networks (GIMDNN). The running parameters of DNNs are modeled as a graph by using a kernel function or the Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), where the nodes of the graph are obtained by dimensional mapping of the parameters of the DNNs, and the edges are calculated by the Gaussian kernel function. The generated graphs are classified by a graph convolutional network (GCN). The association relationship between the adjacent layers and the running mechanism of DNNs are analyzed, and the importance of the parameters of each layer in the DNNs for the final classification result can be obtained. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most representative models in DNNs. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on the CNNs. The experimental results show that the proposed method can interpret the associations among the weight parameters as well as the correlation between two adjacent layers. Therefore, the DNNs for special tasks, such as portable applications, edge computing, and so on, can be customized, the number of parameters can be reduced. It is valuable to interpret the operation and principle of CNNs.

AB A primary challenge of using FeCrAl in high temperature industrial settings is the formation of & alpha;& PRIME;-precipitates that causes brittleness in the alloy, resulting in failure through fracture. The precipitation causes hardness change during thermal aging which is sensitive to both alloy composition and experimental condition (i.e., temperature and time of heat treatment). A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model is built on the hardness data collected at GE Research. Subsequently, for the first time, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) built upon the GPR is used as an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool to understand the effect of feature values in driving the hardness change. SHAP analysis has confirmed that the primary chemical driver for & alpha;& PRIME; age hardening in the FeCrAl system is Cr as expected. However, the analysis also indicated that Al does not have a clear trend of only suppressing the formation of & alpha;& PRIME; which contradicts current literature. This lack of a trend on the effect of Al on age hardening may be due to Al ability to both suppress thermodynamically and enhance kinetically the formation of & alpha;& PRIME;. Similarly, SHAP analysis points towards Mo having no clear trend towards either enhancing or suppressing & alpha;& PRIME;. This study indicates that more in depth studies focusing on both the chemistry and different aging temperatures (to study kinetics) should be performed to better understand the aging of this system.

AB The labor market is undergoing a rapid artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. There is currently limited empirical scholarship that focuses on how AI adoption affects employment opportunities and work environments in ways that shape worker health, safety, well-being and equity. In this article, we present an agenda to guide research examining the implications of AI on the intersection between work and health. To build the agenda, a full day meeting was organized and attended by 50 participants including researchers from diverse disciplines and applied stakeholders. Facilitated meeting discussions aimed to set research priorities related to workplace AI applications and its impact on the health of workers, including critical research questions, methodological approaches, data needs, and resource requirements. Discussions also aimed to identify groups of workers and working contexts that may benefit from AI adoption as well as those that may be disadvantaged by AI. Discussions were synthesized into four research agenda areas: (1) examining the impact of stronger AI on human workers; (2) advancing responsible and healthy AI; (3) informing AI policy for worker health, safety, well-being, and equitable employment; and (4) understanding and addressing worker and employer knowledge needs regarding AI applications. The agenda provides a roadmap for researchers to build a critical evidence base on the impact of AI on workers and workplaces, and will ensure that worker health, safety, well-being, and equity are at the forefront of workplace AI system design and adoption.

AB Placental examination, frequently performed by general surgical pathologists, plays an important role in understanding patient outcomes and explaining the underlying mechanisms leading to preterm birth (PTB). This secondary analysis of a larger study recurrent PTB aimed to compare diagnoses between general surgical pathologists (GSP) and a perinatal pathologist (PP) in preterm placentas examined between 2009 and 2018 at a single institution. Pathology diagnoses were coded into 4 categories (acute inflammation [AI], chronic inflammation, fetal vascular malperfusion, maternal vascular malperfusion) based on original reports for the GSP and second review by the single PP. A total of 331 placentas were included, representing placentas finalized by 17 GSPs. The prevalence of all 4 placental diagnostic categories was higher for the PP, and nearly half (49.2%) of placentas finalized by GSP had no diagnostic findings. Agreement was highest for AI at ?=0.50 (weak agreement). However, there was no agreement for maternal vascular malperfusion (?=0.063), chronic inflammation (?=0.0026), and fetal vascular malperfusion (?=-0.018). Chronic basal deciduitis with plasma cells had the highest false-negative rate (missed in 107 cases by GSP). Villous infarction had the highest false-positive rate (overcalled in 28/41 [68%] cases) with the majority of the "infarcts" representing intervillous thrombi. In conclusion, there is no agreement between GSP and PP when assessing placental pathology other than AI, and weak agreement even for AI. These findings are a call to action to implement educational efforts and structural/organizational changes to improve consistency of placental pathology reporting.

DT Article; Early Access
ID MORTALITY; DISEASE
AB BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve prenatal detection of congenital heart disease. We analysed the performance of the current national screening programme in detecting hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) to compare with our own AI model.MethodsCurrent screening programme performance was calculated from local and national sources. AI models were trained using four-chamber ultrasound views of the fetal heart, using a ResNet classifier.ResultsEstimated current fetal screening programme sensitivity and specificity for HLHS were 94.3% and 99.985%, respectively. Depending on calibration, AI models to detect HLHS were either highly sensitive (sensitivity 100%, specificity 94.0%) or highly specific (sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 100%). Our analysis suggests that our highly sensitive model would generate 45,134 screen positive results for a gain of 14 additional HLHS cases. Our highly specific model would be associated with two fewer detected HLHS cases, and 118 fewer false positives.ConclusionIf used independently, our AI model performance is slightly worse than the performance level of the current screening programme in detecting HLHS, and this performance is likely to deteriorate further when used prospectively. This demonstrates that collaboration between humans and AI will be key for effective future clinical use.
   What is already known on this topic?Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to interpret medical images and make diagnoses, including detecting fetal congenital heart disease (CHD) by ultrasound.The sensitivity of the current English screening programme for fetal cardiac malformations is publicly available, but specificity is not reported.What this study adds?The current screening programme in our region is operating at a very high specificity for fetal hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).Using a curated retrospective dataset, it is possible to train AI models to detect HLHS with a performance approaching that of the current screening programme.Current AI models do not have high enough specificity to be used independently for screening for fetal CHD, meaning that human-AI interaction when performing or interpreting ultrasound will be important to select cases for specialist referral.

ID RECOMMENDATION
AB Hashtags are the keywords that describe the theme of social media content and have become very popular in influence marketing and trending topics. In recent years, hashtag prediction has become a hot topic in AI research to help users with automatic hashtag recommendations by capturing the theme of the post. Most of the previous work mainly focused only on textual information, but many microblog posts contain not only text but also the corresponding images. This work explores both image-text features of the microblog post. Inspired by the self-attention mechanism of the transformer in natural language processing, the visual-linguistics pre-train model with transfer learning also outperforms many downstream tasks that require image and text inputs. However, most of the existing models for multimodal hashtag recommendation are based on the traditional co-attention mechanism. This paper investigates the cross-modality transformer LXMERT for multimodal hashtag prediction for developing LXMERT4Hashtag, a cross-modality representation learning transformer model for hashtag prediction. It is a large-scale transformer model that consists of three encoders: a language encoder, an object encoder, and a cross-modality encoder. We evaluate the presented approach on dataset InstaNY100K. Experimental results show that our model is competitive and achieves impressive results, including precision of 50.5% vs 46.12%, recall of 44.02% vs 38.93%, and F1-score of 47.04% vs 42.22% compared to the existing state-of-the-art baseline model.

AB Accelerated degradation tests (ADTs) are widely used to assess lifetime information under normal use conditions for highly reliable products. For the accelerated tests, two basic assumptions are that changing stress levels does not affect the underlying distribution family and that there is stochastic ordering for the life distributions at different stress levels. The acceleration invariance (AI) principle for ADTs is proposed to study these fundamental assumptions. Using the AI principle, a theoretical connection between the model parameters and the accelerating variables is developed for Hougaard processes. This concept can be extended to heterogeneous gamma and inverse Gaussian processes. Simulation studies are presented to support the applicability and flexibility of the Hougaard process using the AI principle for ADTs. A real data analysis using the derived relationship is used to validate the AI principle for accelerated degradation analysis. All technical details, simulation results for nonlinear cases and model mis-specification analysis are available online as Supporting Information.

AB The education system has been changing continuously with several new strategies for effective student learning. E-learning has provided the opportunity for students to learn from anywhere and from anyone. To motivate the learners and improve their performance in e-learning courses, different pedagogical activities have been practiced among which gamification has a good edge. Gamification is one of the upcoming fields in education for getting students motivated and engaged through game-like activities with various gamification elements in nongame settings. Gamification can be further improved by dynamically adapting the mechanics and dynamics of gamification to a variety of factors such as the personality, needs, values, performance, and motivations of learners. The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) enables the development of dynamically adapting gamification environments with established AI techniques. The application of AI in adaptive gamification needs to be further explored to discover new approaches. This study provides a comprehensive report of adaptive gamification from the perspective of the existing studies, which map different gamification elements, user profile elements, and intelligent techniques through a systematic literature analysis. Research questions have been formulated and the findings have been presented by exploring 29 focused studies from a selected pool of 622 research articles. The findings have identified the commonly used gamification elements and presented the methods of incorporating them with various AI techniques based on different user profile elements.

ID CURIOSITY
AB This paper seeks to answer the question: Can contemporary forms of artificial intelligence be creative? To answer this question, I consider three conditions that are commonly taken to be necessary for creativity. These are novelty, value, and agency. I argue that while contemporary AI models may have a claim to novelty and value, they cannot satisfy the kind of agency condition required for creativity. From this discussion, a new condition for creativity emerges. Creativity requires curiosity, a motivation to pursue epistemic goods. I argue that contemporary AI models do not satisfy this new condition. Because they lack both agency and curiosity, it is a mistake to attribute the same sort of creativity to AI that we prize in humans. Finally, I consider the question of whether these AI models stand to make human creativity in the arts and sciences obsolete, despite not being creative themselves. I argue, optimistically, that this is unlikely.

AB This paper discusses about the modern techniques implemented in the field of agriculture which shaped the traditional farming to the smart farming (Agriculture 4.0). The rapid rise in the global population is one among the main reasons, besides monitoring of crops health and yield requires a huge labor force, which is also another reason for promoting intelligent systems into agriculture sector. Conventional farming methods are not suitable to meet this demand, which led robotics to associate with on-field agriculture by means of robot-based technologies like wheeled robots, ground vehicles (manned and unmanned) and aerial vehicles (manned and unmanned) that led to explore the possible advancement in agriculture 3.0. Currently, the evolutionary techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IoT, are implemented in robotic vehicles to make them intelligent systems. Due to unprecedented climatic change and polluted ground water for the past few decades, the crops are being infested with new varieties of diseases. This requires new image processing techniques to classify the diseases based on color, texture and, shape of leaves. The incorporation of image processing technique into AI aids in deciding the appropriate amount of herbicide supplement to the plant based on the prediction of plant growth.

AB Background: Public awareness of artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing and this novel technology is being used for a range of everyday tasks and more specialist clinical applications. On a background of increasing waits for GP appointments alongside patient access to laboratory test results through the NHS app, this study aimed to assess the accuracy and safety of two AI tools, ChatGPT and Google Bard, in providing interpretation of thyroid function test results as if posed by laboratory scientists or patients.
   Methods: Fifteen fictional cases were presented to a team of clinicians and clinical scientists to produce a consensus opinion. The cases were then presented to ChatGPT and Google Bard as though from healthcare providers and from patients. The responses were categorized as correct, partially correct or incorrect compared to consensus opinion and the advice assessed for safety to patients.
   Results: Of the 15 cases presented, ChatGPT and Google Bard correctly interpreted only 33.3% and 20.0% of cases, respectively. When queries were posed as a patient, 66.7% of ChatGPT responses were safe compared to 60.0% of Google Bard responses. Both AI tools were able to identify primary hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism but failed to identify subclinical presentations, non-thyroidal illness or secondary hypothyroidism.
   Conclusions: This study has demonstrated that AI tools do not currently have the capacity to generate consistently correct interpretation and safe advice to patients and should not be used as an alternative to a consultation with a qualified medical professional. Available AI in its current form cannot replace human clinical knowledge in this scenario.

AB PurposeDental implant abutments are defined as medical devices by their intended use. Surfaces of custom-made CAD/CAM two-piece abutments may become contaminated during the manufacturing process in the dental lab. Inadequate reprocessing prior to patient care may contribute to implant-associated complications. Risk-adapted hygiene management is required to meet the requirements for medical devices.MethodsA total of 49 CAD/CAM-manufactured zirconia copings were bonded to prefabricated titanium bases. One group was bonded, polished, and cleaned separately in dental laboratories throughout Germany (LA). Another group was left untreated (NC). Five groups received the following hygiene regimen: three-stage ultrasonic cleaning (CP and FP), steam (SC), argon-oxygen plasma (PL), and simple ultrasonic cleaning (UD). Contaminants were detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and segmented and quantified using interactive machine learning (ML) and thresholding (SW). The data were statistically analysed using non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn's test).ResultsSignificant differences in contamination levels with the different cleaning procedures were found (p & LE; 0.01). The FP-NC/LA groups showed the most significant difference in contamination levels for both measurement methods (ML, SW), followed by CP-LA/NC and UD-LA/NC for SW and CP-LA/NC and PL-LA/NC for ML (p & LE; 0.05). EDS revealed organic contamination in all specimens; traces of aluminum, silicon, and calcium were detected.ConclusionsChemothermal cleaning methods based on ultrasound and argon-oxygen plasma effectively removed process-related contamination from zirconia surfaces. Machine learning is a promising assessment tool for quantifying and monitoring external contamination on zirconia abutments.

AB Artificial intelligence is currently changing many areas of society. Especially in health, where critical decisions are made, questions of control must be renegotiated: who is in control when an automated system makes clinically relevant decisions? Increasingly, the concept of meaningful human control (MHC) is being invoked for this purpose. However, it is unclear exactly how this concept is to be understood in health. Through a systematic review, we present the current state of the concept of MHC in health. The results show that there is not yet a robust MHC concept for health. We propose a broader understanding of MHC along three strands of action: enabling, exercising and evaluating control. Taking into account these strands of action and the established rules and processes in the different health sectors, the MHC concept needs to be further developed to avoid falling into two gaps, which we have described as theoretical and labelling gaps.

ID CARDIAC SARCOIDOSIS; LUNG; ABNORMALITIES; IMAGES
AB PurposeSarcoidosis is a complex disease which can affect nearly every organ system with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic imaging findings to sudden cardiac death. As such, diagnosis and prognostication are topics of continued investigation. Recent technological advancements have introduced multiple modalities of artificial intelligence (AI) to the study of sarcoidosis. Machine learning, deep learning, and radiomics have predominantly been used to study sarcoidosis.MethodsArticles were collected by searching online databases using keywords such as sarcoid, machine learning, artificial intelligence, radiomics, and deep learning. Article titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance by a single reviewer. Articles written in languages other than English were excluded.ConclusionsMachine learning may be used to help diagnose pulmonary sarcoidosis and prognosticate in cardiac sarcoidosis. Deep learning is most comprehensively studied for diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis and has less frequently been applied to prognostication in cardiac sarcoidosis. Radiomics has primarily been used to differentiate sarcoidosis from malignancy. To date, the use of AI in sarcoidosis is limited by the rarity of this disease, leading to small, suboptimal training sets. Nevertheless, there are applications of AI that have been used to study other systemic diseases, which may be adapted for use in sarcoidosis. These applications include discovery of new disease phenotypes, discovery of biomarkers of disease onset and activity, and treatment optimization.

AB As Electric Vehicles (EVs) become increasingly prevalent, accurately estimating Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is crucial for ensuring safety and avoiding operational risks beyond their service life threshold. However, directly measuring battery capacity during EV operation is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages measurable features based on the discharge time and battery temperature to estimate RUL. Our framework relies on a novel feature extraction strategy that accurately characterizes the battery, leading to improved RUL predictions. Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed and evaluated. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately estimates capacity with minimal hyperparameter tuning. The R-2 scores across various battery numbers indicate strong predictive performance for models like XGBoost, RF, AdaBoost, and others, with improvement percentages ranging from 85% to 99%, which the model's generalizability verifies across other batteries. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed method in accurately estimating the RUL of LIBs in EVs.

AB The electromagnetic (EM) detection and sensing research of human signs are becoming much more attractive, especially with the rise of intelligent metasurface which can strongly enhance the control abilities and functionalities of transmitting and receiving EM fields. It proposes the design of integrating-type intelligent metasurface to realize the indoor positioning and posture recognition of the human body using the support vector machine algorithm and a new deep learning algorithm model it proposed called MetaNet. The integrating-type metasurface with the in-plane feed rather than horn excitation is real low profile, and the varactor based programmable phase shifters achieving 360-degree cover and continuous control of phase are independently embedded in each unit cell for further synthesized manipulation of apertures. One pair of integrating-type intelligent metasurfaces are fabricated for transmitting and receiving EM fields, respectively. Also, the corresponding prototype of radar transceiver system is developed and manufactured to rapidly acquire massive data. The total experimental flow can include two main steps that first, the transmitting and receiving beams of metasurfaces should scan dynamically and synchronously under the method of far-field synthesis for detecting the direction of the human. Second, the transmitting beam should keep the detected direction and the receiving apertures of metasurface should be varied by randomly control the phase shift of each unit cell for multiple sensing. Based on the technology of deep learning to process the massive receiving data, the profile images and key points of various human postures can be reconstructed very well in the measurement that can verify the validity of the proposed sensing system.
   An integrated-type intelligent metasurface-based sensing system combined with AI technology is proposed for efficient indoor human target positioning and posture recognition and can be applied for identity identification, security detection, and other fields in the future. This resulted in an average positioning accuracy of 92%, an imaging accuracy of 94%, and a key point detection error of 3.80 pixels.image

AB ObjectivesProgression of aortic insufficiency during left-ventricular assist device (LVAD) support is a crucial topic. One treatment option is aortic valvuloplasty (AVP); however, there is controversy regarding its safety and efficacy. We investigated the safety and efficacy of AVP using the coaptation stitch method (Park's stitch) performed for de novo aortic insufficiency.MethodsBetween 2013 and 2020, 175 consecutive patients underwent LVAD implantation, of which 7 patients [men, 2 (28.6%); median age, 55 years] underwent late-stage AVP. Two patients underwent AVP within 2 weeks, and the remaining six patients underwent AVP 3, 19, 24, 28, 42, and 49 months, respectively, after LVAD implantation.ResultsPreoperatively, the degree of aortic insufficiency was moderate in 6 (85.7%) patients and severe in 1 (14.3%) patient. AVP was technically successful in 6 (85.7%) patients, while one case of failed plasty was subsequently treated with bioprosthetic valve replacement. A 1-year post-AVP right heart catheterization study revealed a median pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 10.0 mmHg. No deaths or heart failure admissions occurred during the follow-up (median, 38.0 months). There was no aortic insufficiency in 2 (28.6%) patients; however, trivial AI was observed in 3 (42.8%) patients, and mild AI was observed in 1 (14.3%) patient 2 years postoperatively. However, at the 3-year follow-up, two patients developed an increase in AI grade from trivial to mild.ConclusionsAVP using Park's stitch was safe. It is critical to carefully observe the aortic valve during AVP surgery to ensure that AVP is appropriate.

AB Building on previous radar-based human activity recognition (HAR), we expand the micro-Doppler signature to 6 domains and exploit each domain with a set of handcrafted features derived from the literature and our patents. An adaptive thresholding method to isolate the region of interest is employed, which is then applied in other domains. To reduce the computational burden and accelerate the convergence to an optimal solution for classification accuracy, a holistic approach to HAR optimisation is proposed using a surrogate model-assisted differential evolutionary algorithm (SADEA-I) to jointly optimise signal processing, adaptive thresholding and classification parameters for HAR. Two distinct classification models are evaluated with holistic optimisation: SADEA-I with support vector machine classifiers (SVM) and SADEA-I with AlexNet. They achieve an accuracy of 89.41% and 93.54%, respectively. This is an improvement of & SIM;11.3% for SVM and & SIM;2.7% for AlexNet when compared to the performance without SADEA-I. The effectiveness of our holistic approach is validated using the University of Glasgow human radar signatures dataset. This proof of concept is significant for dimensionality reduction and computational efficiency when facing a multiplication of radar representation domains/feature spaces and transmitting/receiving channels that could be individually tuned in modern radar systems.
   This study enhances radar-based human activity recognition by expanding the micro-Doppler signature (MDS) to six domains, each exploited with a patented set of handcrafted features. We also introduce a novel holistic optimisation approach using the surrogate model-assisted differential evolutionary algorithm (SADEA-I), which jointly optimises signal processing, adaptive thresholding, and classification parameters, significantly reducing computational burden and improving classification accuracy. Our optimisation approach proves crucial for efficient dimensionality reduction and computational performance in the context of modern radar systems with diverse representation domains and tunable transmitting/receiving channels.image

DT Review; Early Access
DE artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; deep learning; GPT; informatics and
   telecommunications in psychiatry
AB ChatGPT has sparked extensive discussions within the healthcare community since its November 2022 release. However, potential applications in the field of psychiatry have received limited attention. Deep learning has proven beneficial to psychiatry, and GPT is a powerful deep learning-based language model with immense potential for this field. Despite the convenience of ChatGPT, this advanced chatbot currently has limited practical applications in psychiatry. It may be used to support psychiatrists in routine tasks such as completing medical records, facilitating communications between clinicians and with patients, polishing academic writings and presentations, and programming and performing analyses for research. The current training and application of ChatGPT require using appropriate prompts to maximize appropriate outputs and minimize deleterious inaccuracies and phantom errors. Moreover, future GPT advances that incorporate empathy, emotion recognition, personality assessment, and detection of mental health warning signs are essential for its effective integration into psychiatric care. In the near future, developing a fully-automated psychotherapy system trained for expert communication (such as psychotherapy verbatim) is conceivable by building on foundational GPT technology. This dream system should integrate practical 'real world' inputs and friendly AI user and patient interfaces via clinically validated algorithms, voice comprehension/generation modules, and emotion discrimination algorithms based on facial expressions and physiological inputs from wearable devices. In addition to the technology challenges, we believe it is critical to establish generally accepted ethical standards for applying ChatGPT-related tools in all mental healthcare environments, including telemedicine and academic/training settings.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; NETWORKS; AI
AB Purpose: The growing application of deep learning in radiology has raised concerns about cybersecurity, particularly in relation to adversarial attacks. This study aims to systematically review the literature on adversarial attacks in radiology.Methods: We searched for studies on adversarial attacks in radiology published up to April 2023, using MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases.Results: A total of 22 studies published between March 2018 and April 2023 were included, primarily focused on image classification algorithms. Fourteen studies evaluated white-box attacks, three assessed black-box attacks and five investigated both. Eleven of the 22 studies targeted chest X-ray classification algorithms, while others involved chest CT (6/22), brain MRI (4/22), mammography (2/22), abdominal CT (1/22), hepatic US (1/22), and thyroid US (1/22). Some attacks proved highly effective, reducing the AUC of algorithm performance to 0 and achieving success rates up to 100 %. Conclusions: Adversarial attacks are a growing concern. Although currently the threats are more theoretical than practical, they still represent a potential risk. It is important to be alert to such attacks, reinforce cybersecurity measures, and influence the formulation of ethical and legal guidelines. This will ensure the safe use of deep learning technology in medicine.

AB The interpretation of spectral data, including mass, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and ultraviolet-visible spectra, is critical for obtaining molecular structural information. The development of advanced sensing technology has multiplied the amount of available spectral data. Chemical experts must use basic principles corresponding to the spectral information generated by molecular fragments and functional groups. This is a time-consuming process that requires a solid professional knowledge base. In recent years, the rapid development of computer science and its applications in cheminformatics and the emergence of computer-aided expert systems have greatly reduced the difficulty in analyzing large quantities of data. For expert systems, however, the problem-solving strategy must be known in advance or extracted by human experts and translated into algorithms. Gratifyingly, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) methods has shown great promise for solving such problems. Traditional algorithms, including the latest neural network algorithms, have shown great potential for both extracting useful information and processing massive quantities of data. This Perspective highlights recent innovations covering all of the emerging AI-based spectral interpretation techniques. In addition, the main limitations and current obstacles are presented, and the corresponding directions for further research are proposed. Moreover, this Perspective gives the authors' personal outlook on the development and future applications of spectral interpretation.

TI Proteome deconvolution of liver biopsies reveals hepatic cell
   composition as an important marker of fibrosis
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL

DE Fibrosis; Proteomics; Biomarker; Liver; Deconvolution; Computational
   Methods
AB Human liver tissue is composed of heterogeneous mixtures of different cell types and their cellular stoichiometry can provide information on hepatic physiology and disease progression. Deconvolution algorithms for the identification of cell types and their proportions have recently been developed for transcriptomic data. However, no method for the deconvolution of bulk proteomics data has been presented to date. Here, we show that proteomes, which usually contain less data than transcriptomes, can provide useful information for cell type deconvolution using different algorithms. We demonstrate that proteomes from defined mixtures of cell lines, isolated primary liver cells, and human liver biopsies can be deconvoluted with high accuracy. In contrast to transcriptome-based deconvolution, liver tissue proteomes also provided information about extracellular compartments. Using deconvolution of proteomics data from liver biopsies of 56 patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery we show that proportions of immune and stellate cells correlate with inflammatory markers and altered composition of extracellular matrix proteins characteristic of early-stage fibrosis. Our results thus demonstrate that proteome deconvolution can be used as a molecular microscope for investigations of the composition of cell types, extracellular compartments, and for exploring cell-type specific pathological events. We anticipate that these findings will allow the refinement of retrospective analyses of the growing number of proteome datasets from various liver disease states and pave the way for AI-supported clinical and preclinical diagnostics.

ID MODEL
AB Employing the solutions through artificial intelligence (AI) to solve mechanical engineering problems can pave the way toward accelerating the computation process, especially for those engaged with the dynamic nature of the time-variable systems. In this regard, this article attempts to employ deep neural networks (DNN) for the coupled thermoelasticity assessment of the longitudinally sandwiched plates exposed to intensive thermal shock. The left and right face sheets of the sandwich plate are enriched with graphene platelets (GPLs) along the longitudinal direction. The thermal shock is considered as the instantaneous heat flux applied in the axial direction. Elasticity theory is employed for deriving the governing equations in an exact template and differential quadrature approach (DQA) in conjunction with the Laplace transform plays the role of solution approaches to attain the thermoelastic reaction of the sandwich system at training points. Then, the DNN utilizes these points to adjust a predictor mechanism for analyzing the behavior of the sandwich system in every load-exertion circumstances. Additionally, the DNN would be optimized by a brand-new metaheuristic algorithm according to some error estimation criteria to minimize the error of regression. The mentioned solution is validated by comparing its performance with the outcomes of the published literature. This study provides a novel platform to use the great potential of AI-based methods in solving dynamic thermoelastic problems in the world of solid structures.

AB Study Objectives This study compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the salience network (SN) between rotating shift workers (RSWs) and controls. Furthermore, we examined whether rsFC of the SN was correlated with sleep, emotion, cognition, and attention.Methods The 60 RSWs and 57 controls enrolled in this study completed self-report questionnaires and sleep diaries to assess subjective sleep quality, and polysomnography and actigraphy to evaluate objective sleep and 24-hour rest-activity rhythm parameters. The participants also underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and structural T1 scans. We performed a seed-based rsFC analysis of the SN using the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AI) as seed regions. Furthermore, AI and ACC rsFC were compared in RSWs and controls, and we analyzed correlations between rsFC and variables of interest showing significant group differences.Results Compared with controls, RSWs showed reduced rsFC between the ACC and right insula, and increased rsFC of the ACC with the left occipital lobe and right superior frontal gyrus extending to the supplementary motor area (SFG/SMA). Moreover, RSWs showed reduced rsFC between the right AI and right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Finally, rsFC between the ACC and right AI was correlated with 24-hour rest-activity rhythmicity.Conclusions Although RSWs did not show sleep disturbance, emotional distress, cognitive impairment, or attention deficits, alterations of right insula, left occipital lobe, right SFG/SMA, and right SPL rsFC in the SN indicate that impairments in salience detection and top-down attentional control may emerge in shift workers over time.

AB Biometric measurements in fetal ultrasound images are one of the most highly demanding medical image analysis tasks that can directly contribute to diagnosing fetal diseases. However, the natural high-speckle noise and shadows in ultrasound data present big challenges for automatic biometric measurement. Almost all the existing dominant automatic methods are two-stage models, where the key anatomical structures are segmented first and then measured, thus bringing segmentation and fitting errors. What is worse, the results of the second-stage fitting are completely dependent on the good performance of first-stage segmentation, i.e., the segmentation error will lead to a larger fitting error. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end biometric measurement network, abbreviated as E2EBM-Net, that directly fits the measurement parameters. E2EBM-Net includes a cross-level feature fusion module to extract multi-scale texture information, a hard-soft attention module to improve position sensitivity, and center-focused detectors jointly to achieve accurate localizing and regressing of the measurement endpoints, as well as a loss function with geometric cues to enhance the correlations. To our knowledge, this is the first AI-based application to address the biometric measurement of irregular anatomical structures in fetal ultrasound images with an end-to-end approach. Experiment results showed that E2EBM-Net outperformed the existing methods and achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Dense and complex air traffic requires higher levels of automation than those exhibited by tactical conflict detection and resolution (CD & R) tools that air traffic controllers (ATCOs) use today: AI tools can act on their own initiative, increasing the capacity of ATCOs to control higher volumes of traffic. However, given that the air traffic control (ATC) domain is safety critical, requires AI systems to which ATCOs are comfortable to relinquishing control, guaranteeing operational integrity and automation adoption. Two major factors towards this goal are quality of solutions and operational transparency. ResoLver, the system that this article presents, addresses these challenges using an enhanced graph convolutional reinforcement learning method operating in a multiagent setting where each agent - representing a flight - performs a CD & R task, jointly with other agents. We show that ResoLver can provide high-quality solutions with respect to stakeholders interests (air traffic controllers and airspace users), addressing also operational transparency issues, which have been validated by ATCOs in simulated real-world settings.

ID EVOLUTION
AB Technology trend studies on patent analyses of hydrogen technology are critical in understanding the status of present and future technology, as well as, its market opportunity. However, the studies were mostly limited to specific countries and lacked the details of green hydrogen production technology. In this study, a patent analysis forecasting future green hydrogen technology was carried out. To make the patent database for the analysis, first, a comprehensive survey on green hydrogen projects worldwide was conducted and hydrogen-related technologies were classified into two network categories of the standalone and the grid-connected type, as well as three options for renewable energy resources, Energy Storage System (ESS) and hydrogen utilization type. More than a thousand patents during the past twenty years on green hydrogen technology were directly collected from the Worldwide Intellectual Property Service (WIPS) website using quantitative and qualitative searches. The patents were classified into two technology types, water electrolysis and system operation, and seven technology areas within two types. The patents were further analyzed according to year, country, technology area, and major applicants. Overall, the technology type of system operation accounts for 53% compared to water electrolysis, which indicates that companies are more focused on system integration and control strategies rather than green hydrogen production. Furthermore, the four commercial water electrolysis types were analyzed to predict the near-term trend, showing that the Alkaline (ALK) and Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) approaches are at the stage of entering maturity, while Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) and Solid Oxidation (SO) approaches are still in the early development stages. In addition, AEM approach shows fewer patents and applicants, indicating a lower entry barrier to the market. Lastly, the three most impactful patents in the world were identified for each of the seven technology areas.& COPY; 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted extensive and public concerns about this technology's capacity to contribute to the spread of misinformation, algorithmic bias, and cybersecurity breaches and to pose, potentially, existential threats to humanity. We suggest that although these threats are both real and important to address, the heightened attention to AI's harms has distracted from human beings' outsized role in perpetuating these same harms. We suggest the need to recalibrate standards for judging the dangers of AI in terms of their risks relative to those of human beings. Further, we suggest that, if anything, AI can aid human beings in decision making aimed at improving social equality, safety, productivity, and mitigating some existential threats.

AB Since ChatGPT's release in November 2022, artificial intelligence has come into the spotlight. Inspiring both fascination and fear, chatbots have stirred debates among researchers, developers, and policy makers. The concerns range from concrete and tangible ones-which include replication of existing biases and discrimination at scale, harvesting personal data, and spreading misinformation-to more existential fears that their development will lead to machines with human-like cognitive abilities. Understanding how chatbots work and the human labor and data involved can better help evaluate the validity of concerns surrounding these systems, which although innovative, are hardly the stuff of science fiction.

AB Chatbots and other artificial-intelligence applications that mimic human conversation or writing have rapidly become some of the most popular tech applications of all time. Expert analysis and media coverage of the risks and benefits of AI have paid scant attention to how chatbots might affect public health at a time when depression, suicide, anxiety, and mental illness are epidemic in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Many experts have pointed to a correlation between declining mental health and increasing online engagement. Generative AI's potential to transform education, the job market, and social interactions could come at the expense of humanity's own mental faculties, creativity, and social skills. Chatbots-which are prone to errors and fabrications-could also make it more difficult for humans to tell fact from fiction. But to the extent that mental health experts and the healthcare industry are interested in AI, it's mostly viewed as a promising tool for identifying and treating mental health issues, rather than a potential threat to mental health.

AB Global governance of artificial intelligence (AI) must grapple with four monumental challenges. AI is a tough problem to govern given the speed, scale, and uncertainty of its progress. Various aspects of the AI problem require governing because of the range of benefits, risks, and impacts on other global issues. Multilateral efforts on AI are nascent, as is national-level policy. And the multilateral system is under immense pressure from institutional gridlock, fragmentation, and geopolitical competition. No one global governance model for AI is perfect, or desirable. Instead, policymakers must pursue several governance models, each starting in a targeted and focused manner before evolving. They must make clear what policy outcomes are being sought and which institutional functions are needed to reach those outcomes. AI governance within regional and multilateral issue-based groupings would commit nations to action and test models for governing AI globally. And national champions will be critical to success. This pragmatic yet optimistic path will allow humanity to maximize the benefits of artificial intelligence applications and distribute them as widely as possible, while mitigating harms and reducing risks as effectively as possible.

AB The associability of artificial intelligence (AI) as a dual-use technology for nuclear material production (NMP) within the academic and practitioner communities remains widely neglected, and so a widening opportunity for AI to aid in illicit and covert non-peaceful applications exists. To address this emerging gap, this paper investigates the evolving and applicable uses of AI and finds broad evidence of its use to optimize performance, promote innovation, reduce costs, and enhance safety associated with the development and production of nuclear material. AI's use in this arena will, thereby, facilitate broader accessibility of peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, while at the same time cause concerns that said improvements can aid the illicit development of nuclear weapons. As such, this paper advocates for a three-dimensional solution to manage the evolving dual-use concern of AI that involves advancing states-centric monitoring and regulation, promoting intellectual exchange between the nonproliferation sector and the AI industry, and encouraging AI industrial contributions.

AB In this paper, we analyze the effects of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on the news media market. We model a representative consumer who allocates their time between reading news and deceptive articles. We find that GenAI may induce consumers to inefficiently reallocate their time and increase the consumption of the lower value good, i.e. deceptive content (clickbait articles or fake news). Therefore, early-stage GenAI distorts the incentives of consumers and reduces their welfare. After GenAI technology reaches a certain threshold, however, consumers start benefiting from its advancements. Finally, we find that the negative effects of early-stage GenAI are exacerbated as they induce a lower level of investment in news production.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB ObjectiveAlthough artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated promise in enhancing breast cancer diagnosis, the implementation of AI algorithms in clinical practice encounters various barriers. This scoping review aims to identify these barriers and facilitators to highlight key considerations for developing and implementing AI solutions in breast cancer imaging.MethodA literature search was conducted from 2012 to 2022 in six databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINHAL, Embase, IEEE, and ArXiv). The articles were included if some barriers and/or facilitators in the conception or implementation of AI in breast clinical imaging were described. We excluded research only focusing on performance, or with data not acquired in a clinical radiology setup and not involving real patients.ResultsA total of 107 articles were included. We identified six major barriers related to data (B1), black box and trust (B2), algorithms and conception (B3), evaluation and validation (B4), legal, ethical, and economic issues (B5), and education (B6), and five major facilitators covering data (F1), clinical impact (F2), algorithms and conception (F3), evaluation and validation (F4), and education (F5).ConclusionThis scoping review highlighted the need to carefully design, deploy, and evaluate AI solutions in clinical practice, involving all stakeholders to yield improvement in healthcare.Clinical relevance statementThe identification of barriers and facilitators with suggested solutions can guide and inform future research, and stakeholders to improve the design and implementation of AI for breast cancer detection in clinical practice.Key Points & BULL; Six major identified barriers were related to data; black-box and trust; algorithms and conception; evaluation and validation; legal, ethical, and economic issues; and education.& BULL; Five major identified facilitators were related to data, clinical impact, algorithms and conception, evaluation and validation, and education.& BULL; Coordinated implication of all stakeholders is required to improve breast cancer diagnosis with AI.Key Points & BULL; Six major identified barriers were related to data; black-box and trust; algorithms and conception; evaluation and validation; legal, ethical, and economic issues; and education.& BULL; Five major identified facilitators were related to data, clinical impact, algorithms and conception, evaluation and validation, and education.& BULL; Coordinated implication of all stakeholders is required to improve breast cancer diagnosis with AI.Key Points & BULL; Six major identified barriers were related to data; black-box and trust; algorithms and conception; evaluation and validation; legal, ethical, and economic issues; and education.& BULL; Five major identified facilitators were related to data, clinical impact, algorithms and conception, evaluation and validation, and education.& BULL; Coordinated implication of all stakeholders is required to improve breast cancer diagnosis with AI.

DT Editorial Material
AB Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have been changing the landscape in daily life and the practice of medicine. As these tools have evolved to become consumer-friendly, AI has become more accessible to many individuals, including applicants to medical school. With the rise of AI models capable of generating complex passages of text, questions have arisen regarding the appropriateness of using such tools to assist in the preparation of medical school applications.In this commentary, the authors offer a brief history of AI tools in medicine and describe large language models, a form of AI capable of generating natural language text passages. They question whether AI assistance should be considered inappropriate in preparing applications and compare it with the assistance some applicants receive from family, physician friends, or consultants. They call for clearer guidelines on what forms of assistance-human and technological-are permitted in the preparation of medical school applications. They recommend that medical schools steer away from blanket bans on AI tools in medical education and instead consider mechanisms for knowledge sharing about AI between students and faculty members, incorporation of AI tools into assignments, and the development of curricula to teach the use of AI tools as a competency.

AB This paper focuses on robust controller design for a generic helicopter model and terrain avoidance problem via artificial intelligence (AI). The helicopter model is presented as a hybrid system that covers hover and forward dynamics. By defining a set of easily accessible parameters, it can be used to simulate the motion of different helicopter types. A robust control structure based on reinforcement learning is proposed to ensure the system is robust against model parameter uncertainties. The developed generic model can be utilized in many helicopter applications that have been attempted to be solved with sampling-based algorithms or reinforcement learning approaches that take the dynamical constraints into consideration. This study also focuses on the helicopter terrain avoidance problem to illustrate how the model can be useful in these types of applications and provide an artificial intelligence-aided solution to terrain avoidance.

AB This paper proposes a method for detecting and recognizing partial discharges in high-voltage (HV) equipment. The aim is to address issues commonly found in traditional systems, including complex operations, high computational demands, significant power consumption, and elevated costs. Various types of discharges were investigated in an HV laboratory environment. Discharge data were collected using a high-frequency current sensor and a microcontroller. Subsequently, this data underwent processing and transformation into feature sets using the phase-resolved partial discharge analysis technique. These features were then converted into grayscale map samples in PNG format. To achieve partial discharge classification, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on these samples. After successful training, the network model was adapted for deployment on a microcontroller, facilitated by the STM32Cube.AI ecosystem, enabling real-time partial discharge recognition. The study also examined storage requirements across different CNN layers and their impact on recognition efficacy. To assess the algorithm's robustness, recognition accuracy was tested under varying discharge voltages, insulation media thicknesses, and noise levels. The test results demonstrated that the algorithm could be effectively implemented on a microcontroller, achieving a recognition accuracy exceeding 98%.

AB The field of regenerative medicine is constantly advancing and aims to repair, regenerate, or substitute impaired or unhealthy tissues and organs using cutting-edge approaches such as stem cell-based therapies, gene therapy, and tissue engineering. Nevertheless, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has opened new doors for research in this field. AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence in ways such as learning the patterns in the data and applying that to the new data without being explicitly programmed. AI has the potential to improve and accelerate various aspects of regenerative medicine research and development, particularly, although not exclusively, when complex patterns are involved. This review paper provides an overview of AI in the context of regenerative medicine, discusses its potential applications with a focus on personalized medicine, and highlights the challenges and opportunities in this field.

AB Children commonly experience pain and distress in healthcare settings related to medical procedures such as blood tests and intravenous insertions (IVIs). Inadequately addressed pain and distress can result in both short- and long-term negative consequences. The use of socially assistive robotics (SARs) to reduce procedure-related distress and pain in children's healthcare settings has shown promise; however, the current options lack autonomous adaptability. This study presents a descriptive qualitative needs assessment of healthcare providers (HCPs) in two Canadian pediatric emergency departments (ED) to inform the design an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced social robot to be used as a distraction tool in the ED to facilitate IVIs. Semi-structured virtual individual and focus group interviews were conducted with eleven HCPs. Four main themes were identified: (1) common challenges during IVIs (i.e., child distress and resource limitations), (2) available tools for pain and distress management during IVIs (i.e., pharmacological and non-pharmacological), (3) response to SAR appearance and functionality (i.e., personalized emotional support, adaptive distraction based on child's preferences, and positive reinforcement), and (4) anticipated benefits and challenges of SAR in the ED (i.e., ensuring developmentally appropriate interactions and space limitations). HCPs perceive AI-enhanced social robots as a promising tool for distraction during IVIs in the ED.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are increasingly used in everyday life. Whereas some are widely accepted (e.g., automatically compiled playlists), others are highly controversial (e.g., using AI in the classroom). The public discourse reveals a somewhat ambiguous perception of AI, with enthusiasm about the tremendous positive potential of AI on the one hand and growing concerns about the existential dangers of uncontrolled artificial intelligence on the other hand. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms of what shapes people's per-ceptions of AI is vital to help explain AI usage and acceptance trends. In our research, we take a cognitive approach by measuring the perceived risks and benefits of AI applications considering people's knowledge and confidence in their knowledge. To this end, we assessed in two studies (N = 394 and N = 437; representative) how knowledge about AI and confidence in AI knowledge is related to participants' risk-benefit perception of AI scenarios from three domains: media, medicine, and autonomous driving. Results showed that both AI knowl-edge and confidence in AI knowledge are predictors regarding people's risk-benefit perception beyond people's attitudes towards AI. More specifically, people with more knowledge about AI exhibited so-called risk blindness; that is, they underestimated the risks. On the other hand, higher confidence in one's AI knowledge impacted participants' benefit assessment. Knowledge and confidence thus open a new dimension of understanding peo-ple's perception of risks and benefits in AI.

TI Hybrid Techniques of Facial Feature Image Analysis for Early Detection

SO DIAGNOSTICS

DT Article

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication and repetitive behaviors. The exact causes of ASD remain elusive and likely involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Doctors often face challenges in accurately identifying ASD early due to its complex and diverse presentation. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with ASD. Early diagnosis allows for timely access to appropriate interventions, leading to better social and communication skills development. Artificial intelligence techniques, particularly facial feature extraction using machine learning algorithms, display promise in aiding the early detection of ASD. By analyzing facial expressions and subtle cues, AI models identify patterns associated with ASD features. This study developed various hybrid systems to diagnose facial feature images for an ASD dataset by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) features. The first approach utilized pre-trained VGG16, ResNet101, and MobileNet models. The second approach employed a hybrid technique that combined CNN models (VGG16, ResNet101, and MobileNet) with XGBoost and RF algorithms. The third strategy involved diagnosing ASD using XGBoost and an RF based on features of VGG-16-ResNet101, ResNet101-MobileNet, and VGG16-MobileNet models. Notably, the hybrid RF algorithm that utilized features from the VGG16-MobileNet models demonstrated superior performance, reached an AUC of 99.25%, an accuracy of 98.8%, a precision of 98.9%, a sensitivity of 99%, and a specificity of 99.1%.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a topic of substantial interest for radiologists in recent years. Although many of the first clinical applications were in the neuro, cardiothoracic, and breast imaging subspecialties, the number of investigated and real-world applications of body imaging has been increasing, with more than 30 FDA-approved algorithms now available for applications in the abdomen and pelvis. In this manuscript, we explore some of the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning, review major functions that AI algorithms may perform, introduce current and potential future applications of AI in abdominal imaging, provide a basic understanding of the pathways by which AI algorithms can receive FDA approval, and explore some of the challenges with the implementation of AI in clinical practice.

DE SOWFA simulation; Wake effect; Machine learning
AB Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) is a powerful wind farm simulation tool. It is widely used in wake effect research. However, the integration between AI and SOWFA is weak. Without AI, it is difficult for us to fully use SOWFA. The installation, parameter settings, and calculation procedures of SOWFA are complex, which hinders the application of SOWFA in practical power system engineering scenarios. To mitigate these issues, a batch simulation tool of SOWFA based on Docker and Python is designed and implemented. Firstly, the Docker engine is used to realize the virtualization container management of SOWFA. A SOWFA installation image is built to make it easy to migrate and deploy. Secondly, a Python application programming interface (API) of the SOWFA container is programmed to realize parameter editing, calculation process management, and batch simulations. Finally, a batch simulation post-processing Python API is constructed based on the ParaView library so that the SOWFA batch simulation results can be collated into data samples for downstream tasks. The above SOWFA image and Python API are tested in a simple single-turbine wake analysis scenario. With the samples generated by the batch simulations, an autoencoder-based single-turbine wake prediction surrogate model is trained, which verifies the effectiveness of the SOWFA batch simulation tool designed in this paper.

AB Electrocardiography (ECG) is a standard diagnostic tool for evaluating the overall heart's electrical activity and is vital for detecting many cardiovascular diseases. Classifying ECG recordings using deep neural networks has been investigated in literature and has shown very good performance. However, this performance assumes that the training data is centralized, which is often not the case in real-life scenarios, where data resides in multiple places and only a small portion of it is labeled. Therefore, in this work, we propose an ECG classification system that focuses on preserving data privacy and enhancing overall system efficiency. We analyzed the complexity of previously proposed deep learning-based models and showed that the temporal convolutional network-based models (TCN) were the most efficient. Then, we built on the TCN models a modified split-learning (SL) system that achieves the same classification performance as the basic SL but reduces the communication overhead between the server and the client by 71.7% as well as reducing the computations at the client by 46.5% compared to the original SL system based on the TCN network. Finally, we implement semi-supervised learning in our system to enhance its classification performance by 9.1%-15.7%, when the training data consists only of 10% labeled data. We have tested our proposed system on a test IoT setup and it achieved satisfactory classification accuracy while being private and energy efficient for green-AI applications.

AB Electronic skin (e-skin) mimics human skin and is an indispensable part of wearable technology with widespread applications ranging from robotics to health care. Designing and fabricating e-skins equipped with multifunctionality is the focus of current research that amalgamates materials with a variety of structures and unique properties. Several attempts toward various mechanisms and materials that make e-skin flexible, stretchable, and sensitive have been reported. At the material level, graphene is the most suitable material for e-skin owing to its excellent electronic, electrical, and mechanical properties. Although remarkable progress has been made in this field over the years, fabricating multifunctional smart e-skin is still a challenge. This perspective article explores the recent advances in e-skin through graphene as a material example and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in wearable technology. In this study, an emphasis has been laid on the applications of AI in wearable devices along with a brief insight into the advantages, and limitations of AI and ML in the field of medicine.

AB The incidence of pediatric craniofacial fractures and heterogeneity of fractures is known to increase with age. This study aimed to determine the occurrence of associated injuries (AIs) to craniofacial fractures and identify differences in patterns of and predictors for AIs in children and teenagers. A 6-year retrospective cross-sectional cohort study was designed and implemented. The study population included 397 patients aged 19 years or less diagnosed with craniofacial fracture at Helsinki University Hospital from 2013 to 2018. Boys (71.0%) and teenagers (64.7%) were predominated. Associated injuries were more common in teenagers than children. Teenagers had more often AI in 2 or more organ systems. Assault and intoxication by alcohol were observed only in teenagers and predominantly boys. A total of 27.0% of all patients sustained AIs. In 18.1%, brain injury was reported. In children, motor vehicle accident (MVA) was an independent predictor for AI. In teenagers, independent predictors for AI were female sex, isolated cranial fracture, combined cranial fracture, and high-energy trauma mechanism. Injury patterns and AI related to craniofacial fractures in the pediatric population are age-specific, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of such trauma. Predictors for AIs increase in complexity with age, and the role of sex as a predictor is evident in teenagers.

AB Blowout fractures are a common type of facial injury that requires accurate measurement of the fracture area for proper treatment planning. This systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate the current methods for measuring blowout fracture areas and explore the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing accuracy and reliability. A comprehensive search of the PubMed database was conducted, focusing on studies published since 2000 that investigated methods for measuring blowout fracture area using computed tomography scans. The review included 20 studies, and the results showed that automatic methods, such as computer-aided measurements and computed tomography-based volumetric analysis, provide higher accuracy and reliability compared with manual and semiautomatic techniques. Standardizing the method for measuring blowout fracture areas can improve clinical decision-making and facilitate outcome comparison across studies. Future research should focus on developing AI models that can account for multiple factors, including fracture area and herniated tissue volume, to enhance their accuracy and reliability. Integration of AI models has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes in the assessment and management of blowout fractures.

AB The collision-coalescence of cloud droplets in atmospheric turbulent flow is analyzed numerically using di-rect numerical simulation coupled to a Lagrangian particle tracking. The droplet aerodynamic interactions (AI) are repre-sented for employing two complementary approaches. For large separations, the interaction forces are evaluated by the superposition of Stokes disturbance velocities generated by moving particles. When the distance between droplets is com-parable to their mean radii, lubrication forces are additionally considered. Simulation results show that without gravita-tional acceleration, aerodynamic interactions decrease the kinetics of the coalescence process but do not significantly impact the size spectrum broadening. The influence of AI on the coalescence kinetics is more complex in the presence of gravity and depends on the mass loading and on droplet inertia. Long-range aerodynamic interactions reduce the coales-cences in dilute suspensions but increase the collision rate in dense suspensions of high-inertia droplets. In contrast, lubrica-tion forces decrease the collision rate regardless of the mass loading. The collision efficiency induced by aerodynamic interactions additionally is influenced by the radius ratio of colliding droplets and the mechanisms leading to raindrops for-mation and growth. In cloud-like conditions, both long-and short-range AI decrease the fraction of raindrops created by collisions between droplets (autoconversion) while promoting raindrops growth by accretion (collection by settling drops). In turn, aerodynamic interactions favor the growth of a limited number of droplets and promote the broadening of the droplet size spectrum. This effect is stronger in dilute suspensions of weakly inertial droplets, corresponding to the flow properties encountered in developing precipitation.

AB An automated Condition Monitoring (CM) and real-time controlling framework is essential for outdoor mobile robots to ensure the robot's health and operational safety. This work presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled CM and vibrotactile haptic-feedback-based real-time control framework suitable for deploying mobile robots in dynamic outdoor environments. It encompasses two sections: developing a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) model for predicting system degradation and terrain flaws threshold classes and a vibrotactile haptic feedback system design enabling a remote operator to control the robot as per predicted class feedback in real-time. As vibration is an indicator of failure, we identified and separated system- and terrain-induced vibration threshold levels suitable for CM of outdoor robots into nine classes, namely Safe, moderately safe system-generated, and moderately safe terrain-induced affected by left, right, and both wheels, as well as severe classes such as unsafe system-generated and unsafe terrain-induced affected by left, right, and both wheels. The vibration-indicated data for each class are modelled based on two sensor data: an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor for the change in linear and angular motion and a current sensor for the change in current consumption at each wheel motor. A wearable novel vibrotactile haptic feedback device architecture is presented with left and right vibration modules configured with unique haptic feedback patterns corresponding to each abnormal vibration threshold class. The proposed haptic-feedback-based CM framework and real-time remote controlling are validated with three field case studies using an in-house-developed outdoor robot, resulting in a threshold class prediction accuracy of 91.1% and an effectiveness that, by minimising the traversal through undesired terrain features, is four times better than the usual practice.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been applied to solve various remote sensing problems. To fully leverage the power of AI and ML to tackle impactful remote sensing problems, it is essential to enable researchers and practitioners to understand how AI and ML models actually work and thus to improve the model performance strategically. Accurate and timely land cover maps are essential components for informed land management decision making. To address the ever-increasing need for high spatial and temporal resolution maps, this paper developed an interactive and open-source online tool, in Python, to help interpret and improve the ML models used for land cover mapping with Google Earth Engine (GEE). The tool integrates the workflow of both land cover classification and land cover change dynamics, which requires the generation of a time series of land cover maps. Three feature importance metrics are reported, including impurity-based, permutation-based, and SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) value-based feature importance. Two case studies are presented to showcase the tool's capability and ease of use, enabling a globally accessible and free convergent application of remote sensing technologies. This tool may inspire researchers to facilitate explainable AI (XAI)-empowered remote sensing applications with GEE.

AB Post-stroke depression and anxiety, collectively known as post-stroke adverse mental outcome (PSAMO) are common sequelae of stroke. About 30% of stroke survivors develop depression and about 20% develop anxiety. Stroke survivors with PSAMO have poorer health outcomes with higher mortality and greater functional disability. In this study, we aimed to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict the risk of PSAMO. We retrospectively studied 1780 patients with stroke who were divided into PSAMO vs. no PSAMO groups based on results of validated depression and anxiety questionnaires. The features collected included demographic and sociological data, quality of life scores, stroke-related information, medical and medication history, and comorbidities. Recursive feature elimination was used to select features to input in parallel to eight ML algorithms to train and test the model. Bayesian optimization was used for hyperparameter tuning. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), an explainable AI (XAI) method, was applied to interpret the model. The best performing ML algorithm was gradient-boosted tree, which attained 74.7% binary classification accuracy. Feature importance calculated by SHAP produced a list of ranked important features that contributed to the prediction, which were consistent with findings of prior clinical studies. Some of these factors were modifiable, and potentially amenable to intervention at early stages of stroke to reduce the incidence of PSAMO.

AB Vaccines for avian influenza (AI) can protect poultry against disease, mortality, and virus transmission. Numerous factors, including: vaccine platform, immunogenicity, and relatedness to the field strain, are known to be important to achieving optimal AI vaccine efficacy. To better understand how these factors contribute to vaccine protection, a systematic meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate efficacy data for vaccines in chickens challenged with highly pathogenic (HP) AI. Data from a total of 120 individual trials from 25 publications were selected and evaluated. Two vaccine criteria were evaluated for their effects on two metrics of protection. The vaccine criteria were: 1) the relatedness of the vaccine antigen and challenge strain in the hemagglutinin 1 domain (HA1) protein sequence; 2) vaccine-induced antibody titers to the challenge virus (VIAC). The metrics of protection were: A) survival of vaccinated chickens vs unvaccinated controls; and B) reduction in oral virusshedding by vaccinated vs unvaccinated controls 2-4 days post challenge. Three vaccine platforms were evaluated: oil-adjuvanted inactivated whole AI virus, recombinant herpes virus of turkeys (rHVT) vectored, and a non-replicating alpha-virus vectored RNA particle (RP) vaccine. Higher VIAC correlated with greater reduction of virus-shed and vaccine efficacy by all vaccine platforms. Both higher HA1 relatedness and higher VIAC using challenge virus as antigen correlated with better survival by inactivated vaccines and rHVT-vectored vaccines. However, rHVT-vectored and RP based vaccines were more tolerant of variation in the HA1; the relatedness of the HA1 of the vaccine and challenge virus did not significantly correlate with survival with rHVT-vectored vaccines. Protection was achieved with the lowest aa similarity for which there was data, 90-93 % for rHVT vaccines and 88 % for the RP vaccine.

TI Automating Rey Complex Figure Test scoring using a deep learning-based
   approach: a potential large-scale screening tool for cognitive decline

ID OSTERRIETH; MEMORY
AB Background The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) has been widely used to evaluate the neurocognitive functions in various clinical groups with a broad range of ages. However, despite its usefulness, the scoring method is as complex as the figure. Such a complicated scoring system can lead to the risk of reducing the extent of agreement among raters. Although several attempts have been made to use RCFT in clinical settings in a digitalized format, little attention has been given to develop direct automatic scoring that is comparable to experienced psychologists. Therefore, we aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) scoring system for RCFT using a deep learning (DL) algorithm and confirmed its validity.
   Methods A total of 6680 subjects were enrolled in the Gwangju Alzheimer's and Related Dementia cohort registry, Korea, from January 2015 to June 2021. We obtained 20,040 scanned images using three images per subject (copy, immediate recall, and delayed recall) and scores rated by 32 experienced psychologists. We trained the automated scoring system using the DenseNet architecture. To increase the model performance, we improved the quality of training data by re-examining some images with poor results (mean absolute error (MAE) >= 5 [points]) and retrained our model. Finally, we conducted an external validation with 150 images scored by five experienced psychologists.
   Results For fivefold cross-validation, our first model obtained MAE = 1.24 [points] and R-squared (R-2) = 0.977. However, after evaluating and updating the model, the performance of the final model was improved (MAE = 0.95 [points], R-2 = 0.986). Predicted scores among cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia were significantly different. For the 150 independent test sets, the MAE and R2 between AI and average scores by five human experts were 0.64 [points] and 0.994, respectively.
   Conclusion We concluded that there was no fundamental difference between the rating scores of experienced psychologists and those of our AI scoring system. We expect that our AI psychologist will be able to contribute to screen the early stages of Alzheimer's disease pathology in medical checkup centers or large-scale community-based research institutes in a faster and cost-effective way.

AB Purpose The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of various skeletal and dental cephalometric parameters as produced by different commercial providers that make use of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted automated cephalometric analysis and to compare their quality to a gold standard established by orthodontic experts.
   Methods Twelve experienced orthodontic examiners pinpointed 15 radiographic landmarks on a total of 50 cephalometric X-rays. The landmarks were used to generate 9 parameters for orthodontic treatment planning. The "humans' gold standard" was defined by calculating the median value of all 12 human assessments for each parameter, which in turn served as reference values for comparisons with results given by four different commercial providers of automated cephalometric analyses (DentaliQ.ortho [CellmatiQ GmbH, Hamburg, Germany], WebCeph [AssembleCircle Corp, Seongnam-si, Korea], AudaxCeph [Audax d.o.o., Ljubljana, Slovenia], CephX [Orca Dental AI, Herzliya, Israel]). Repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) were calculated and Bland-Altman plots were generated for comparisons.
   Results The results of the repeated measures ANOVAs indicated significant differences between the commercial providers' predictions and the humans' gold standard for all nine investigated parameters. However, the pairwise comparisons also demonstrate that there were major differences among the four commercial providers. While there were no significant mean differences between the values of DentaliQ.ortho and the humans' gold standard, the predictions of AudaxCeph showed significant deviations in seven out of nine parameters. Also, the Bland- Altman plots demonstrate that a reduced precision of AI predictions must be expected especially for values attributed to the inclination of the incisors.
   Conclusion Fully automated cephalometric analyses are promising in terms of timesaving and avoidance of individual human errors. At present, however, they should only be used under supervision of experienced clinicians.

AB In recent years, the data security and privacy protection of human cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted much research interest. In the meantime, applying human-machine identity authentication mechanism to the CPSs has been considered as a promising solution for secure and privacy-enhancing authentication in industrial IoT. In view of the application limitation of traditional authentication methods, especially during the current COVID-19 virus outbreak, themainstream face recognition and fingerprint recognition methods are constrained by wearing masks and gloves. Recently, with the flourishing studies of artificial intelligence (AI), many AI-based dynamic gesture recognition methods have been developed for the application of human-computer identity recognition. A temporal segment network (TSN) has been designed with a dual-stream convolutional neural network inside to match the flexibility of gesture transformations. Although it has achieved a success in accuracy, the TSN still has the main shortcomings of the insufficient temporal information fusion and the high cost of optical flow feature extraction. In this article, we propose an enhanced temporal segment network (dubbed as e-TSN). First, hand skeleton features are used instead of optical flowfeatures. Second, a short-term networks (long short-term memory) is utilized as segmental consensus function to improve the accuracy and reduce the feature extraction cost. Experiments demonstrate that the e-TSN can achieve an accuracy of 91.3% on the Jester dataset. Finally, a human-machine identity verification system is developed based on the e-TSN, which caneffectually accomplish the human-machine identity in real time and has a high promotion value.

AB IMPORTANCE Characterizing the scale and factors associated with hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections could help inform hospital and public health policies regarding prevention and surveillance needs for these infections.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate associations of hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection rates with different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital characteristics, and testing practices.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study of US hospitals reporting SARS-CoV-2 testing data in the PINC AI Healthcare Database COVID-19 special release files was conducted from July 2020 through June 2022. Data were collected from hospitals that reported at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or antigen test during hospitalizations discharged that month. For each hospital-month where the hospital reported sufficient data, all hospitalizations discharged in that month were included in the cohort. SARS-CoV-2 viral tests and results reported in the microbiology files for all hospitalizations in the study period by discharge month were identified. Data analysis was conducted from September 2022 to March 2023.
   EXPOSURE Hospitalizations discharged in an included hospital-month.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multivariable generalized estimating equation negative-binomial regression models were used to assess associations of monthly rates of hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections per 1000 patient-days (defined as a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test during after hospitalization day 7) with the phase of the pandemic (defined as the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in circulation), admission testing rates, and hospital characteristics (hospital bed size, teaching status, urban vs rural designation, Census region, and patient distribution variables).
   RESULTS A total of 5687 hospital-months from 288 distinct hospitals were included, which contributed 4 421 268 hospitalization records. Among 171 564 hospitalizations with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 7591 (4.4%) were found to be hospital onset and 6455 (3.8%) were indeterminate onset. The mean monthly hospital-onset infection rate per 1000 patient-days was 0.27 (95 CI, 0.26-0.29). Hospital-onset infections occurred in 2217 of 5687 hospital-months (39.0%). The monthly percentage of discharged patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission varied; 1673 hospital-months (29.4%) had less than 25% of hospitalizations tested at admission; 2199 hospital-months (38.7%) had 25% to 50% of all hospitalizations tested, and 1815 hospital months (31.9%) had more than 50% of all hospitalizations tested at admission. Postadmission testing rates and community-onset infection rates increased with admission testing rates. In multivariable models restricted to hospital-months testing at least 25% of hospitalizations at admission, a 10% increase in community-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was associated with a 178% increase in the hospital-onset infection rate (rate ratio, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.52-3.07). Additionally, the phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the admission testing rate, Census region, and bed size were all significantly associated with hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort study of hospitals reporting SARS-CoV-2 infections, there was an increase of hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections when community-onset infections were higher, indicating a need for ongoing and enhanced surveillance and prevention efforts to reduce in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections, particularly when community-incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is high.

AB Phosphorus enrichment and recovery from wastewater, as well as its use as fertilizer in agricultural output, is an efficient method of addressing both phosphorus pollution and phosphorus resource scarcity. In this study, Zn/Al/Zr LDH with hydrothermal carbon loading (ZARH) composites were prepared by co-precipitation method and applied to simulate the efficient enrichment of phosphorus in wastewater. The microstructural characterization showed that ZARH-3 composites had a large specific surface area and multiple adsorption sites. Within 120 minutes, ZARH-3 composites could remove 99% phosphorus (25 mg/L). Furthermore, the saturation adsorption capacity of the composites was 26.64 mg/g when pH was 5. Both the Langmuir and Temkin models accurately described the isothermal adsorption data (R-2 > 0.99). Finally, zeta potential, XPS, and FT-IR were used to explain the adsorption mechanism of phosphorus by ZARH-3 composites. Results show that phosphorus was enriched by interacting with the composites primarily through ion exchange, electrostatic interaction, and ligand exchange. In conclusion, ZARH-3 composites prepared in this study is a highly efficient adsorbent for phosphorus removal from aqueous solutions. This research can provide scientific basis for the efficient remediation of eutrophication water body containing phosphorus and effective recovery of phosphorus resources.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Comprehending why an artificial intelligence-based agent makes certain predictions is often discussed as one of the central issues that needs to be solved in the near future to make such agents ubiquitously deployable. However, many common black-box machine learning models are hard to analyse. Recently, we proposed a new machine learning algorithm to construct concise sets of rules. This algorithm, SupRB, creates compact, interpretable and transparent models. One key feature that differentiates it from many similar previously proposed systems is that it optimizes the model selection tasks concerning rule discovery and rule set composition separately. Therefore, users can tailor a model's structure more easily towards fulfilling use-case specific explainability requirements. Keeping the model selection tasks separate during optimization allows for more clearly defined goals when compared to state-of-the-art systems and - importantly - facilitates independent rule fitnesses, making the training process easier to explain and the models easier to analyse post-hoc. In this paper, we extend previous benchmarking of SupRB, where it was compared with XCSF, a prominent rule set learning system, to also include Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) in our analysis. We find that - as expected - SupRB performs comparable to XCSF, while allowing easier control of model structure and showing a substantially smaller sensitivity to random seeds and data splits, and it performs slightly worse than RFs, and better than DTs. Importantly, the overall model size was substantially smaller with SupRB, making it the easiest to interpret system while not falling significantly short in terms of prediction errors.

TI Comparison of Ophthalmologist and Large Language Model Chatbot Responses
   to Online Patient Eye Care Questions
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English
DT Article
AB IMPORTANCE Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT appear capable of performing a variety of tasks, including answering patient eye care questions, but have not yet been evaluated in direct comparison with ophthalmologists. It remains unclear whether LLM-generated advice is accurate, appropriate, and safe for eye patients.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the quality of ophthalmology advice generated by an LLM chatbot in comparison with ophthalmologist-written advice.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used deidentified data from an online medical forum, in which patient questions received responses written by American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)-affiliated ophthalmologists. A masked panel of 8 board-certified ophthalmologists were asked to distinguish between answers generated by the ChatGPT chatbot and human answers. Posts were dated between 2007 and 2016; data were accessed January 2023 and analysis was performed between March and May 2023.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Identification of chatbot and human answers on a 4-point scale (likely or definitely artificial intelligence [AI] vs likely or definitely human) and evaluation of responses for presence of incorrect information, alignment with perceived consensus in the medical community, likelihood to cause harm, and extent of harm.
   RESULTS A total of 200 pairs of user questions and answers by AAO-affiliated ophthalmologists were evaluated. The mean (SD) accuracy for distinguishing between AI and human responses was 61.3% (9.7%). Of 800 evaluations of chatbot-written answers, 168 answers (21.0%) were marked as human-written, while 517 of 800 human-written answers (64.6%) were marked as AI-written. Compared with human answers, chatbot answers were more frequently rated as probably or definitely written by AI (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.52-1.93). The likelihood of chatbot answers containing incorrect or inappropriate material was comparable with human answers (PR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77-1.10), and did not differ from human answers in terms of likelihood of harm (PR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.07) nor extent of harm (PR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.80-1.22).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study of human-written and AI-generated responses to 200 eye care questions from an online advice forum, a chatbot appeared capable of responding to long user-written eye health posts and largely generated appropriate responses that did not differ significantly from ophthalmologist-written responses in terms of incorrect information, likelihood of harm, extent of harm, or deviation from ophthalmologist community standards. Additional research is needed to assess patient attitudes toward LLM-augmented ophthalmologists vs fully autonomous AI content generation, to evaluate clarity and acceptability of LLM-generated answers from the patient perspective, to test the performance of LLMs in a greater variety of clinical contexts, and to determine an optimal manner of utilizing LLMs that is ethical and minimizes harm.

AB In an era of increasing global challenges, two paradigmatic shifts - the digital and green transitions - have gained traction due to their potential impacts on industrial ecosystems and societal inequalities. Termed the 'twin transition', these shifts underscore the synergies between technological advancements and environmental sustainability. Highlighting its importance in post-COVID-19 recovery, the special issue examines the twin transition's potential to drive industrial innovation and affect social, economic, and geographical inequalities. The seven articles in this special issue explore the impact of the twin transition on corporate innovation strategies and investment, alongside the economic, social, and geographical implications. Key findings underscore the need for diversified technological investments, especially in AI, and enhanced digital infrastructures. Policy recommendations advocate for aiding firms lagging in digitalisation and developing region-specific innovation policies. The research sets a roadmap for future inquiries into the interplay of digital and green transition, broader economic impacts, and policy-driven strategies.

DT Article

   population; pediatrics
AB Radiology has been a pioneer in adopting artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled devices into the clinic. However, initial clinical experience has identified concerns of inconsistent device performance across different patient populations. Medical devices, including those using AI, are cleared by the FDA for their specific indications for use (IFUs). IFU describes the disease or condition the device will diagnose or treat, including a description of the intended patient population. Performance data evaluated during the premarket submission support the IFU and include the intended patient population. Understanding the IFUs of a given device is thus critical to ensuring that the device is used properly and performs as expected. When devices do not perform as expected or malfunction, medical device reporting is an important way to provide feedback about the device to the manufacturer, the FDA, and other users. This article describes the ways to retrieve the IFU and performance data information as well as the FDA medical device reporting systems for unexpected performance discrepancy. It is crucial that imaging professionals, including radiologists, know how to access and use these tools to improve the informed use of medical devices for patients of all ages.

AB Escherichia coli is a major concern in the food industry because of its ability to produce biofilm causing food contamination. Autoinducer 2 (AI-2) in E. coli is used to regulate quorum sensing (QS) which controls its physiological functions and pathogenicity, especially biofilm formation. Inhibition of the QS is an alternative decontamination approach in the food industry. In this study, 9 bacterial strains isolated from mangrove forests demonstrated their ability to inhibit the bioluminescent production of Vibrio campbellii biosensor strain. Bacteria were identified and Staphylococcus warneri was chosen for further characterization. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the cell-free supernatant (CFS) extract against E. coli ATCC 25922 was 25 mg/mL. The CFS extract at 1/2-and 1/4-MIC showed 70-100% and 28-62% biofilm reduction against biofilm-forming E. coli, respectively. The reduction of biofilm and cell attachment was observed under SEM. LC/MS analysis demonstrated that 21 compounds were identified and the active compound on the QS will further be investigated in future research. From our study, we concluded that S. warneri isolated from mangrove forests can produce bioactive compounds interfering QS system, inhibiting E. coli biofilm and demonstrating the potential to develop a novel biocontrol agent for decontamination of biofilm-forming bacteria contaminated in food production.

AB Catheter ablation (CA) is considered as one of the most effective methods technique for eradicating persistent and abnormal cardiac arrhythmias. Nevertheless, in some cases, these arrhythmias are not treated properly, resulting in their recurrences. If left untreated, they may result in complications such as strokes, heart failure, or death. Until recently, the primary techniques for diagnosing recurrent arrhythmias following CA were the findings predisposing to the changes caused by the arrhythmias on cardiac imaging and electrocardiograms during follow-up visits, or if patients reported having palpitations or chest discomfort after the ablation. However, these follow-ups may be time-consuming and costly, and they may not always determine the root cause of the recurrences. With the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI), these follow-up visits can be effectively shortened, and improved methods for predicting the likelihood of recurring arrhythmias after their ablation procedures can be developed. AI can be divided into two categories: machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), the latter of which is a subset of ML. ML and DL models have been used in several studies to demonstrate their ability to predict and identify cardiac arrhythmias using clinical variables, electrophysiological characteristics, and trends extracted from imaging data. AI has proven to be a valuable aid for cardiologists due to its ability to compute massive amounts of data and detect subtle changes in electric signals and cardiac images, which may potentially increase the risk of recurrent arrhythmias after CA. Despite the fact that these studies involving AI have generated promising outcomes comparable to or superior to human intervention, they have primarily focused on atrial fibrillation while atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial tachycardia (AT) were the subjects of relatively few AI studies. Therefore, the aim of this review is to investigate the interaction of AI algorithms, electrophysiological characteristics, imaging data, risk score calculators, and clinical variables in predicting cardiac arrhythmias following an ablation procedure. This review will also discuss the implementation of these algorithms to enable the detection and prediction of AFL and AT recurrences following CA.

TI Reinforcement learning relieves the vaccination dilemma
SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB The main goal of this paper is to study how a decision-making rule for vaccination can affect epidemic spreading by exploiting the Bush-Mosteller (BM) model, one of the methodologies in reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence (AI), which can realize the systematic process of learning in humans, on complex networks. We consider the BM model with two stages-vaccination and epidemiological processes-and address two independent rules about fixed loss consideration and average payoff of neighbors to update agent's vaccination behavior for various stimuli, such as loss of payoffs and environments during the vaccination process. Higher sensitivity not only favors higher vaccination coverage rates but also delays the transition point in relative vaccination costs when transitioning from full vaccination (inoculation level 1) to incomplete vaccination (inoculation level less than 1). Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the vaccination dilemma can be overcome to some extent, and the distribution of the intended vaccination probabilities in both independent rules is either normal or skewed when different parameters are considered. Since AI is contributing to many fields, we expect that our BM-empowered learning can ultimately resolve the vaccination dilemma.

AB Background: An artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm has been developed for fully automated body composition assessment of lung cancer screening noncontrast low-dose CT of the chest (LDCT) scans, but the utility of these measurements in disease risk prediction models has not been assessed.
   Purpose: To evaluate the added value of CT-based AI-derived body composition measurements in risk prediction of lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, cardiovascular disease (CVD) death, and all-cause mortality in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST).
   Materials and Methods: In this secondary analysis of the NLST, body composition measurements, including area and attenuation attributes of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue, were derived from baseline LDCT examinations by using a previously developed AI algorithm. The added value of these measurements was assessed with sex- and cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with and without the AI-derived body composition measurements for predicting lung cancer incidence, lung cancer death, CVD death, and all-cause mortality. Models were adjusted for confounding variables including age; body mass index; quantitative emphysema; coronary artery calcification; history of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke; and other PLCOM2012 lung cancer risk factors. Goodness-of-fit improvements were assessed with the likelihood ratio test.
   Results: Among 20 768 included participants (median age, 61 years [IQR, 57-65 years]; 12317 men), 865 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 4180 died during follow-up. Including the AI-derived body composition measurements improved risk prediction for lung cancer death (male participants: chi(2) = 23.09, P < .001; female participants: chi(2) = 15.04, P = .002), CVD death (males: chi(2) = 69.94, P < .001; females: chi(2) = 16.60, P < .001), and all-cause mortality (males: chi(2) = 248.13, P < .001; females: chi(2) = 94.54, P < .001), but not for lung cancer incidence (male participants: chi(2) = 2.53, P = .11; female participants: chi(2) = 1.73, P = .19).
   Conclusion: The body composition measurements automatically derived from baseline low-dose CT examinations added predictive value for lung cancer death, CVD death, and all-cause death, but not for lung cancer incidence in the NLST. (c) RSNA, 2023

AB Long-term exposure to high levels of vibration and noise can have detrimental effects on the health of tractor drivers. This study aimed to evaluate the subjective comfort experienced by drivers operating large-horsepower tractors. A total of 10 tractors sourced from 5 different manufacturers were subjected to testing. The assessment encompassed three operational conditions, namely, idle, maximum torque, and rated power. Objective measurements, including A-weighted sound pressure level (A-SPL), loudness, sharpness, roughness, articulation index (AI), hand vibration, and seat vibration, were collected. Additionally, subjective comfort evaluations were carried out using a paired comparison test. To predict the subjective comfort of tractor drivers, a novel prediction model was developed by employing a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to optimize a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The model successfully achieved accurate predictions of subjective comfort, yielding a maximum prediction error of 4.4%. The study findings revealed that vibration had a more pronounced impact on driver comfort in environments with lower-amplitude noise, whereas high-decibel noise exerted a masking effect on vibration-induced discomfort. In conclusion, the SA-BPNN model, utilizing A-SPL, loudness, sharpness, roughness, AI, hand vibration, and seat vibration as objective parameters, effectively predicted the subjective comfort of tractor drivers. This discovery holds significant implications for tractor manufacturers, who can employ the model to optimize the design of tractor cabs and enhance driver comfort.

AB It is of great value to synchronously resolve the critical issues of the polysulfide shuttle and dendrite growth in ithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, a bifunctional AI-based Material of Institute Lavoisier-53 (MIL-53(AI))/carbon nanotube (MIL-53/CNT) composite is reported for this matter, which was constructed by growing an ordered MIL-53(AI) nanorods array on the CNT film. For the sulfur cathode, the proposed structure serves as a multifunctional interlayer to block polysulfides and accelerate their catalytic conversion, thus efficaciously inhibiting the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, when applied as the anode host material (Li@MIL-53/CNT), the flexible CNT film serves as a self-standing framework to accommodate Li metal and alleviate the volume expansion, while the uniform ion channels built by the MIL-53(AI) nanorods array along with the abundant oxygen groups can homogenize Li ion diffusion, enabling a steady Li plating/stripping behavior and limiting the dendrite growth. Not surprisingly, Li-S full battery with MIL-53/CNT interlayer and Li@MIL-53/CNT anode delivers an appreciable specific capacity of 735 mAh.g(-1) and excellent cycle durability at 5 C, presenting a limited capacity decay of 0.03% per cycle in 500 cycles. Besides, an impressive cycle stability and rate capability are also achieved at high-sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions.

AB With the rapid development of deep neural networks (DNNs), eXplainable AI, which provides a basis for prediction on inputs, has become increasingly important. In addition, DNNs have a vulnerability called an Adversarial Example (AE), which can cause incorrect output by applying special perturbations to inputs. Potential vulnerabilities can also exist in image interpreters such as GradCAM, necessitating their investigation, as these vulnerabilities could potentially result in misdiagnosis within medical imaging. Therefore, this study proposes a black-box adversarial attack method that misleads the image interpreter using Sep-CMA-ES. The proposed method deceptively shifts the focus area of the image interpreter to a different location from that of the original image while maintaining the same predictive labels.

AB Detecting dental problems early can prevent invasive procedures and reduce healthcare costs, but traditional exams may not identify all issues, making radiography essential. However, interpreting X-rays can be time-consuming, subjective, prone to error, and requires specialized knowledge. Automated segmentation methods using AI can improve interpretation and aid in diagnosis and patient education. Our U-Net model, trained on 344 bitewing and periapical X-rays, can identify two pathologies and eight anatomical features. It achieves an overall diagnostic performance of 0.794 and 0.787 in terms of Dice score and sensitivity, respectively, 0.493 and 0.405 for dental caries, and 0.471 and 0.44 for root infections. This successful application of deep learning to dental imaging demonstrates the potential of automated segmentation methods for improving accuracy and efficiency in diagnosing and treating dental disorders.

AB The proliferation of purpose-built sensors and the advancement of predictive AI models have paved the way for the use of AI models in household appliances such as washing machines to improve energy efficiency as well as customer experience. Although there are plenty of sensors deployed in washing machines for monitoring, detection, and control purposes, there is no dedicated sensor to directly measure laundry weight due to cost inefficiency. To fill this gap, we researched machine learning-based soft sensors built on available sensor data. Our ANN-based soft sensor model achieved scores of 94.4% accuracy, 93.1% precision, 91.1% sensitivity, and 91.9% F1 score with cross-validation in estimating laundry weight.

AB Today, images presented to the users by digital cameras are created by sequentially processing the raw data received from the sensor by different signal processing modules. In this traditional approach, in which the signal processing modules are designed independently of each other in accordance with the purpose, the final image quality might be adversely affected due to distortion effects occurred at modules and carried throughout the camera pipeline. In order to eliminate these effects and to ensure the optimization of the camera bus from beginning to end, it is seen that researches on modeling the camera pipeline with deep network architectures have increased in recent years. Within the scope of this paper, the images in the Zurich dataset created for this purpose were edited using Topaz Gigapixel AI and Photomatix Pro 5.0 software, and the final model performance was examined by retraining the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based PYNET[1] network architecture, which is one of the pioneering studies in this field. Considering the PIQUE (Perception based Image Quality Evaluator) metric, which does not need a reference image, the performance of the created model is increased; at the same time, it has been seen that HDR tonemapped image can be constructed by revealing the details in the low and high exposure regions.

AB Automatic underwater vehicle hull Design optimization is a complex engineering process for generating a UUV hull with optimized properties on a given requirement. First, it involves the integration of involved computationally complex engineering simulation tools. Second, it needs integration of a sample efficient optimization framework with the integrated toolchain. To this end, we integrated the CAD tool called FreeCAD with CFD tool openFoam for automatic design evaluation. For optimization, we chose Bayesian optimization (BO), which is a well-known technique developed for optimizing time-consuming expensive engineering simulations and has proven to be very sample efficient in a variety of problems, including hyper-parameter tuning and experimental design. During the optimization process, we can handle infeasible design as constraints integrated into the optimization process. By integrating domain-specific toolchain with AI-based optimization, we executed the automatic design optimization of underwater vehicle hull design. For empirical evaluation, we took two different use cases of real-world underwater vehicle design to validate the execution of our tool. The code for running the experimentation and installing the toolchain can be found here https://github.com/vardhah/ConstraintBOUUVHullDesign.

AB The goal of DARPA's Symbiotic Design of Cyber Physical Systems (SDCPS) program is to develop tools for "correct-by-synthesis" design of cyber physical systems (CPS) and reduce the time from concept to deployment from years to months. Achieving this goal poses several hard challenges. Design spaces are high-dimensional cross-products of discrete and continuous spaces. It can take minutes to hours to evaluate the performance of a design. The human designer's intent is often not concretely articulated. Sometimes designs are not created from scratch but rather by completing or repairing existing ones. This paper outlines how the AIMED system addresses these challenges. AIMED consists of three core technologies. The first is "deformable connector" that eliminates an important type of discreteness from design spaces. Thus, not only is the design space vastly simplified, efficient optimization engines for purely continuous spaces can be used in the search for a design. The second core technology is Inverse Specification, based on inverse reinforcement learning that infers human intent by asking the human a small number of simple preference questions. The third core technology is Gaussian Mixture Models that allows completion and repair of designs and finds not just one but a diversity of solutions. AIMED is illustrated in the context of Unmanned Airborne Vehicles ( UAVs) although it was also applied to the design of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). AIMED was used to automatically discover high-scoring, novel UAVs, unencumbered by biases of planarity and symmetry: a UAV with non-coplanar propellers and another with asymmetric wings. We expect our experience will apply to design of other CPS.

AB Big data and data scientific applications in the modern agriculture are rapidly evolving as the data technology advances and more computational power becomes available. The adoption of big data has enabled farmers and producers to optimize their agricultural activities sustainably with cutting-edge technologies, resulting in eco-friendly and efficient farming. Wireless sensor networks and machine learning have had a direct impact on smart and precision agriculture, with deep learning techniques applied to data collected via sensor nodes. Additionally, internet of things, drones, and robotics are being incorporated into farming techniques. Digital data handling has amplified the information wave, and information and communication technology have been used to deliver benefits to both farmers and consumers. This work highlights the technological implications and challenges that arise in data-driven agricultural practices as well as the research problems that need to be solved.

AB The accelerated growth of computing systems' complexity makes comprehensive design verification challenging and time-consuming. In practice, hard-to-model complex environments are unfeasible to be simulated exhaustively within a reasonable time frame. Therefore, some corner-case conditions can be overlooked and design errors might escape to the final product. This means that it is imperative for the system to be able to detect and locate bugs to enable self-repair. This is particularly crucial during long-term remote missions in order to apply graceful degradation. This paper proposes a novel online design error localization methodology for microprocessors by immediate analysis of traced and buffered signals upon a failure detection event, using a pre-trained Neural Network (NN) and existing processor components, i.e. trace buffers and AI accelerators. An in-house Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework is used to train a tailored Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) NN for error localization at the microprocessor module-level resolution. The proposed approach is validated by simulating a RISC-V implementation with different workload programs. It is demonstrated to be capable of localizing the microprocessor module of bug origin with 92.81% accuracy, on average.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB We introduce an efficient solution for Stackelberg games in the context of a class of Security games and bounded rational attackers. These games model a threat scenario where an attacker can launch multi-stage attacks against a defender who can deploy defensive controls subject to some budget constraints. Because the optimal solution in these games may leave some unspent budget, the question of what to do in this situation arises. In this work, we suggest investing it iteratively in the closest sub-optimal solutions until possible. Here we develop the needed theory and framework, starting from defining sub-optimality and solving the corresponding optimisations. By using total unimodularity and precise linear programming (LP) relaxation, we provide an efficient computational solution to these games. The security improvement of the proposed approach is illustrated with an AI threat scenario.

ID COMPOSITE
AB The following paper presents a novel approach that can be applied to Operational Load Monitoring and Structural Health Monitoring processes. The approach is based on artificial intelligence (AI) and digital image correlation (DIC) techniques. DIC is an optical method that allows measuring full-field structural displacements and strains. In the presented approach only a relatively small fragment of the material's surface is monitored by DIC. The obtained partial image of strains or displacements is then processed by a carefully trained AI model, an image classification network, able to predict the state of whole structure (e.g. materials stresses, potential loss of material continuity). The assumption is that all possible load cases and states of the monitored structure can be identified and simulated, so the data obtained from simulations can then be used to train the image classification network. A numerical example is presented as proof of the presented concept. A modern lightweight aerostructure in the form of a hat-stiffened composite panel was used as monitored structure in the presented example and its Operational Load Monitoring was performed based on a relatively small fragment of normal strains map. The reference maps to train the network were simulated numerically. The prediction model estimates the Tsai-Wu failure criterion value for the whole composite material. The obtained accuracy of predictions proved the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB This study delves into the innovative application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ma-chine learning algorithms in the realm of ethnic fashion design, with a specific emphasis on the Miao women's apparel. We introduce an AI-powered approach that strategically bridges modern technology with traditional elements, denoting a significant stride in the field of fashion design. Our research underscores three major aspects: customization of body shape, fabric selection, and innovative design. An AI-driven statistical methodology was utilized to accurately adapt to the unique body characteristics of Miao women, demonstrating an application of machine learning in pattern recognition. Furthermore, the AI's capacity to analyze the fabric properties was harnessed to optimize material selection, creat-ing a balance between aesthetics and comfort. The innovative use of the Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (MUNIT) algorithm, an AI tool, generated diverse and trendy designs, thereby enriching the distinctiveness of ethnic apparel. Our study accentuates the synergistic blend of traditional crafting methods and modern technological applications, highlighting the role of AI in the sustainable development of ethnic fashion. Additionally, we also demonstrate the advantages of Made-to-Measure (MTM) approaches, emphasizing the importance of individual customization in con-temporary fashion design. This research presents a pioneering exploration at the nexus of AI, pattern recognition, and ethnic fashion design, which has the potential to transform the future of the fashion industry.

AB In greenhouse tomato cultivation, three primary methods of flower pollination exist: insect pollination, physical pollination by vibrating flowers, and artificial pollination using hormone-based chemicals. Insect pollination, the natural method, involves insects (e.g., honeybees) vibrating flowers to collect pollen and nectar. This paper proposes an alternate approach, using small drones to search and pollinate flowers in place of bees autonomously. We report field experiments conducted using these drone technologies. The drone must locate flowers ready for pollination. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) image classification system (AI classifier) using machine learning to identify these flowers. Equipped with an AI classifier, the drone searches for flowers through autonomous flight and positioning technology. Upon identifying a suitable flower during its search, the drone makes contact to pollinate it. Integrating AI-based flower detection, autonomous flight control for flower search, and a pollination control device allows the drone to perform pollination. This study devises these technologies, implements them in a drone, and evaluates their effectiveness through a pollination experiment.

AB With the development of digitalization and Internet technology, enterprise information security is facing more and more challenges. Many enterprises have begun to adopt big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology for risk assessment (RA) and prediction to effectively manage information security risks. This article discusses the application of BD and AI technology in enterprise information security management (ISM) and RA from two aspects. Firstly, the mobile payment signature scheme based on number theory research unit is used to improve the security of the mobile payment system. This scheme uses lattice algorithms to achieve fast key generation, signing, and verification and can resist traditional cryptographic attacks. Secondly, a set of enterprise ISM and RA system is established, including risk identification, RA, monitoring and early warning, emergency response, and other links. BD and AI technology is used to analyze internal and external data to provide accurate RA results to achieve automated RA.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a significant transformation of health care in all medical areas, which could represent "Gutenberg moment" for medicine. The future of medical specialties came largely from human interaction and creativity, forcing physicians to evolve and use AI as a tool in patient care. AI will offer patients safety, autonomy, and access to timely medical care in hard-to-reach areas while reducing administrative burden, screen time, and professional burnout for physicians. AI will also make it possible to reduce the frequency of medical errors and improve diagnostic accuracy through the integration, analysis, and interpretation of information by algorithms and software. The safety of repetitive activities will free up time for health personnel and will enhance the doctor-patient relationship, return to personalized attention and interaction with the patient, through accompaniment, communication, empathy, and trust during illness, activities that will never be replaced by AI. It is still necessary to standardize research in the area, which allows improving the quality of scientific evidence knowing its advantages and risks, accelerating its implementation in current medical practice.

AB This perspective article draws a distinction between some of the well-known drug classification systems and a "Chemistry Classification System" (CCS). Rather than have drug classification based on some simple properties like solubility and permeability or route of systemic elimination, a CCS results in more than four or five classes and each class has distinct properties that impact formulation development. This perspective provides and outline of 13 classes, but a CCS is a flexible system that introduces a thought process for classification. The number of classes is not rigid, and chemists are encouraged to adapt these methods to their own situations. A CCS utilizes machine-learning models and artificial intelligence (AI) to estimate physicochemical properties that result in unique, frequently observed dissolution, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) properties to guide formulation development.

DE TVM; NeuroPilot; Relay IR; Deep Learning; Inference; Pipeline
AB With the increasing demand for machine learning inference on mobile devices, more platforms are emerging to provide AI inferences on mobile devices. One of the popular ones is TVM, which is an end-to-end AI compiler. The major drawback is TVM doesn't support all manufacturer-supplied accelerators. On the other hand, an AI solution for MediaTek's platform, NeuroPilot, offers inference on mobile devices with high performance. Nevertheless, NeuroPilot does not support all of the common machine learning frameworks. Therefore, we want to take advantage of both sides. This way, the solution could accept a variety of machine learning frameworks, including Tensorflow, Pytorch, ONNX, and MxNet and utilize the AI accelerator from MediaTek. We adopt the TVM BYOC flow to implement the solution. In order to illustrate the ability to accept different machine learning frameworks for different tasks, we used three different models to build an application showcase in this work: the face anti-spoofing model from PyTorch, the emotion detection model from Keras, and the object detection model from Tflite. Since these models have dependencies while running inference, we propose a prototype of pipeline algorithm to improve the inference performance of the application showcase.

DE Jetson Nano; OpenMP; CUDA; compilers; runtime systems; offloading
AB The NVIDIA Jetson Nano is a very popular system-on-module and developer kit which brings high-performance specs in a small and power-efficient embedded platform. Integrating a 128-core gpu and a quad-core cpu, it provides enough capabilities to support computationally demanding applications such as AI inference, deep learning and computer vision. While the Jetson Nano family supports a number of apis and libraries out of the box, comprehensive support of OpenMP, one of the most popular apis, is not readily available. In this work we present the implementation of an OpenMP infrastructure that is able to harness both the cpu and the gpu of a Jetson Nano board using the offload facilities of the recent versions of the OpenMP specifications. We discuss the compiler-side transformations of key constructs, the generation of cuda-based code as well as how the runtime support is provided. We also provide experimental results for a number of applications, exhibiting performance comparable with their pure cuda versions.

DE vector processing; SIMD; parallelism; RISC-V; register allocation
AB The use of parallel processing with vector processors is indispensable. The RISC-V vector extension (RVV) is a highly anticipated extension due to the demand for growing AI applications. The modularity and extensibility make RISC-V a popular instruction set in the industry. Compared to SIMD instruction, vector instructions use fewer instructions with a larger register size which can handle multiple registers within one instruction, resulting in higher performance. With the vector grouping mechanism called vector length multiplier (LMUL) provided by RVV, RVV can combine multiple vector registers into one group so that the processor can increase the throughput of processing data under the same issue rate. However, due to the register pressure, the vector length is not always positively relative to the performance. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an LMUL predicator with register-pressure-aware models to accurately assign the proper LMUL for different programs. The algorithm is based on a priority-based register allocation algorithm and considers the cost of the register pressures and program use patterns. This design helps assign the proper vector length multiplier in compile time for RVV. The experiment result shows that, with a total of 76 vectorization cases of TSVC, the proposed register pressure aware length multiplier achieves 73 correct predictions of the optimal value of Length Multiplier.

AB Business Intelligence (BI) requires the collection and organization of important pieces of information (i.e. entities) from multiple sources to provide valuable insights (e.g. business trends) as events (i.e. a specific happening linked with a specific location and time) to users. Online news articles are one of the important information sources that present business news offered by various companies in the market every day all around the world. These news articles often cover the same events and report redundant information. Existing news platforms aim at collecting the key entities from news articles and providing a mechanism to view the latest and relevant business events based on user interest. However, they do not provide a method to model business events and understand them temporally, spatially, and contextually (i.e. changes in the event). For instance, it is crucial to know for how long a business event has been active? How important is its evolution locally, or worldwide? Or how did different companies come up with this event as competitors in the market? The contribution of this research is the exploration of the possibilities of modeling spatial, temporal, and contextual information evolution related to business events through the application of knowledge graphs and text analytics, more specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. The constructed knowledge graphs through Named-Entity Recognition (NER), i.e., an NLP technique, present a compact news representation that tells the key entities of the business event at one glance using linked open data concepts. It enables the assessment of other related news events as well as provides the means for analysis of the influence and evolution of business events.

DE industrial patterns. 3D mapping; deep learning; 3D Scanning
AB Basically, a 3D scanning system comprises high-resolution cameras, optics, and AI algorithms integration to provide multiple benefits to large manufacturing units. Indeed, unlike touch probing, 3D scanning is one of most relevant computer vision application which provides conceptual view of the inspected part. 3D scanners can validate whether the material is sufficient to proceed with machining or not. Alternatively, Camera calibration is an important process in scanning system setup which has direct impact on system performance particularly precision. In this work we attempt to conceptually design and test a fully automated and low-cost scanner for producing three-dimensional models with millimeter-scale resolution for object measurement and inspection. Hence, a stereovision system is set up where pair of cameras is mounted to acquire image pairs to perform a scan. Promising and potential result is achieved by demonstrated analytical and mapped output.

TI A Zipf's law-based text generation approach for addressing imbalance in
   entity extraction
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Data imbalance; Text generation; Entity extraction
ID LANGUAGE
AB Entity extraction is critical in the intelligent advancement across diverse domains. Nevertheless, a challenge to its effectiveness arises from the data imbalance, where certain entities are common while others are scarce. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel text generation approach that harnesses Zipf's law, which is a powerful tool from informetrics for studying human language. By employing characteristics of Zipf's law, words within the documents are classified as common and rare ones. Subsequently, sentences are classified into common and rare ones, and are further processed by text generation models accordingly. Rare entities within the generated sentences are then labeled using human-designed rules, serving as a supplement to the raw dataset, thereby mitigating the imbalance problem. The study presents a case of extracting entities from technical documents, and the extensive experimental results on two datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the significance and potential of Zipf's law in driving the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) is discussed, broadening the scope and coverage of informetrics. By incorporating the foundational principles of informetrics into text generation, this study showcases the pivotal role of informetrics in shaping the design and developmental of AI systems.

AB Background: Several guidelines have been proposed to prevent aromatase inhibitors induced bone loss (AIBL), but there is scarce data on their endorsement in clinical practice.Aim: To assess bone health evaluation and fracture prevention in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer after aromatase inhibitors (AI) initiation.Methods: An historical cohort analysis based on data from the cancer and osteoporosis Maccabi Health Services (MHS) registries from Jan 1st 2009 to Dec 31st 2020. Cases of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer were extracted. Index date was set as the first aromatase inhibitors (AI) purchase. Variables such as age, BMI, smoking history, alcohol use, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, glucocorticosteroid use, previous fractures, BMD T-scores and purchases of AI and anti-resorptive agents were collected. Age under 50, previous cancer, prior major osteoporotic fractures and prior anti-resorptive treatment were exclusion criteria. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to assess the time to outcomes. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazards survival model was performed. Results: A total of 8617 women initiating AI were eligible. The median follow up was 6.1 years. The mean (SD) age at index was 62.8 (9.2), the mean (SD) BMI was 29.1 (5.6). The mean (SD) T-score was-1.3 (1.2) at the lumbar spine,-1.5 (0.9) at the femoral neck and-1.0 (1.0) at the total hip. Twenty percent had type 2 diabetes, 8.1 % were active smokers, 3.8% had rheumatoid arthritis and 1.2% were exposed to glucocorticoids. A total of 37% and 53% underwent a DXA scan at 1 and 2 years from AI initiation, and 12% and 17% were prescribed an anti-resorptive agent at 1 and 2 years from index. Advanced age was associated with a higher rate of evaluation and treatment, while obesity and diabetes were associated with a lower rate. The cumulative incidence of a major osteoporotic fracture was 8.8 and 15.8 % at 5 and 10 years, respectively.Conclusions: Despite the excess risk of fractures, bone health assessment and preventive treatment are still partial and postponed in breast cancer AI treated patients. Strategies to ensure appropriate care are needed.

AB This study examines how employees' perceived AI-supported autonomy influences their innovative performance in hospitality. Drawing on self-determination theory, we proposed and examined a moderated mediation model, positing work exploration as a mediator and AI trust and proactive personality as the two moderators. We collected 407 valid questionnaires in two waves, targeting full-time employees working with AI technology in the hospitality industry. Results demonstrated that perceived AI-supported autonomy is positively related to innovation via exploration. This mediation is moderated by AI trust and proactive personality; therefore, employees who perceive AI-supported autonomy engage in more exploratory activities in the presence of AI trust and proactive personality. The current study illuminates the positive role of AI on employees' autonomy and the consequent work outcomes. Moreover, the findings provide suggestions for hotel human resource practitioners to target potential employees and help them experience the benefits of human - AI interaction in the workplace.

AB Creative artificial intelligence (AI) has received a lot of attention in recent years. Artworks that are introduced to be generated by AI (rather than a human artist) are, however, often evaluated negatively. Integrating extant research, we suggest that AI is ascribed less mind (i.e. agency and experience) which is responsible for this effect. In two experiments (N = 176 and N = 381) we observed negative indirect effects of artist information (AI vs human artist) on the appreciation of visual artworks. The AI is consistently ascribed less agency and less experience than a human artist. Higher levels of experience and agency ascribed to an artist are, in turn, associated with higher appreciation of a piece of art. In both experiments the total effect of artist information on appreciation was not significant. Artist information did not predict whether the artwork deviated positively from viewers' expectations developed before the actual artwork was encountered.

AB The objective of this study is to assess the performance of an innovative AI-powered tool for sex determination using panoramic radiographs (PR) and to explore factors affecting the performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN). The study involved 207,946 panoramic dental X-rays and their corresponding reports from 15 clinical centers in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The PRs were acquired with four different devices, and 58% of the patients were female. Data preprocessing included anonymizing the exams, extracting pertinent information from the reports, such as sex, age, type of dentition, and number of missing teeth, and organizing the data into a PostgreSQL database. Two neural network architectures, a standard CNN and a ResNet, were utilized for sex classification, with both undergoing hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure optimal performance. The CNN model achieved 95.02% accuracy in sex estimation, with image resolution being a significant influencing factor. The ResNet model attained over 86% accuracy in subjects older than 6 years and over 96% in those over 16 years. The algorithm performed better on female images, and the area under the curve (AUC) exceeded 96% for most age groups, except the youngest. Accuracy values were also assessed for different dentition types (deciduous, mixed, and permanent) and missing teeth. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of an AI-driven tool for sex determination using PR and emphasizes the role of image resolution, age, and sex in determining the algorithm's performance.

AB Sexed semen facilitates additional female calf production for the expansion of a herd at a faster rate and also curtails the surplus production of unwanted male calves. A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of sexed semen in indigenous Tharparkar cows based on 114 artificial inseminations (AI) performed at natural oestrus using two protocols i.e., single AI (n = 48) and double AI (n = 66). Overall, the first service conception rate (CR) was significantly higher in double (53.0%) than single (33.3%) AI protocol. The odds ratio of conception rate in double AI was 2.26 (?(2) = 4.4, df = 1, p = .04) with respect to single AI. The time that elapsed since the detection of oestrus to insemination was also analysed. In a single AI protocol, the CR was higher (p < .05) at 16 h (54.6%) than insemination at 8 h (27.0%) following the onset of oestrus. Yet, the CR using double AI protocol did not differ (p = .73) significantly when AIs were performed either at 8 h and 24 h (51.9%) or 16 h and 24 h (57.1%) post onset of oestrus. Besides, like the single AI protocol, the parity of the animals also influenced the CR, being higher in heifers (n = 22) than those of parous (n = 92) cows (72.73 vs. 40.43%, ?(2) = 7.48, df = 1, p = .006) in the present study. The odds ratio of conception in heifers was 3.93 with respect to parous cows. Overall, the birth of female calf was 91.7%. In conclusion, the present study indicates a future promise of the sexed semen for the production of more female offspring from Tharparkar cattle.

AB Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well-known human nosocomial pathogen with an arsenal of virulence factors, including capsular polysaccharides (CPS), fimbriae, flagella, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Our previous study found that alcohol acted as an essential virulence factor for high-alcohol-producing K. pneumoniae (HiAlc Kpn). Integration host factor (IHF) is a nucleoid-associated protein that functions as a global virulence regulator in Escherichia coli. However, the regulatory role of IHF in K. pneumoniae remains unknown. In the present study, we found that deletion of ihfA or ihfB resulted in a slight defect in bacterial growth, a severe absence of biofilm formation and cytotoxicity, and a significant reduction in alcohol production. RNA sequencing differential gene expression analysis showed that compared with the wild-type control, the expression of many virulence factor genes was downregulated in ?ihfA and ?ihfB strains, such as those related to CPS (rcsA, galF, wzi, and iscR), LPS (rfbABCD), type I and type III fimbriae (fim and mrk operon), cellulose (bcs operon), iron transporter (feoABC, fhuA, fhuF, tonB, exbB, and exbD), quorum sensing (lsr operon and sdiA), type II secretion system (T2SS) and type VI secretion system (T6SS) (tssG, hcp, and gspE). Of these virulence factors, CPS, LPS, fimbriae, and cellulose are involved in biofilm formation. In addition, IHF could affect the alcohol production by regulating genes related to glucose intake (ptsG), pyruvate formate-lyase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Our data provided new insights into the importance of IHF in regulating the virulence of HiAlc Kpn.IMPORTANCE Klebsiella pneumoniae is a well-known human nosocomial pathogen that causes various infectious diseases, including urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, and liver abscesses. Our previous studies demonstrated that HiAlc Kpn mediated the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by producing excess endogenous alcohol in vivo. However, the regulators regulating the expression of genes related to metabolism, biofilm formation, and virulence of HiAlc Kpn remain unclear. In this study, the regulator IHF was found to positively regulate biofilm formation and many virulence factors including CPS, LPS, type I and type III fimbriae, cellulose, iron transporter, AI-2 quorum sensing, T2SS, and T6SS in HiAlc Kpn. Furthermore, IHF positively regulated alcohol production in HiAlc Kpn. Our results suggested that IHF could be a potential drug target for treating various infectious diseases caused by K. pneumoniae. Hence, the regulation of different virulence factors by IHF in K. pneumoniae requires further investigation.

AB Using data from a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults, this study explores how trust in key actors to responsibly manage artificial intelligence (AI) develops among members of the U.S. population and how trust, along with other key factors, shapes public attitudes toward AI. Greater trust is linked to stronger support for AI, both directly and indirectly (through risk and benefit perceptions). Furthermore, the strength or direction of the link between trust and support-as well as media diets and trust-differs significantly for liberals and conservatives, suggesting that Americans are indeed beginning to process AI-related information through a political lens.

ID SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; CONTEXT
AB BackgroundEvidence syntheses cite retracted publications. However, citation is not necessarily endorsement, as authors may be criticizing or refuting its findings. We investigated the sentiment of these citations-whether they were critical or supportive-and associations with the methodological quality of the evidence synthesis, reason for the retraction, and time between publication and retraction.MethodsUsing a sample of 286 evidence syntheses containing 324 citations to retracted publications in the field of pharmacy, we used AMSTAR-2 to assess methodological quality. We used scite.ai and a human screener to determine citation sentiment. We conducted a Pearson's chi-square test to assess associations between citation sentiment, methodological quality, and reason for retraction, and one-way ANOVAs to investigate association between time, methodological quality, and citation sentiment.ResultsAlmost 70% of the evidence syntheses in our sample were of critically low quality. We found that these critically low-quality evidence syntheses were more associated with positive statements while high-quality evidence syntheses were more associated with negative citation of retracted publications. In our sample of 324 citations, 20.4% of citations to retracted publications noted that the publication had been retracted.ConclusionThe association between high-quality evidence syntheses and recognition of a publication's retracted status may indicate that best practices are sufficient. However, the volume of critically low-quality evidence syntheses ultimately perpetuates the citation of retracted publications with no indication of their retracted status. Strengthening journal requirements around the quality of evidence syntheses may lessen the inappropriate citation of retracted publications.

AB Recent years have brought major technological breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), and firms are expected to invest nearly $98 B in 2023. However, many AI projects never leave the pilot phase, and many companies have difficulties extracting value from their AI initiatives. To explain this contradiction, this article reports on a study of 55 projects implementing AI in organizations. It shows that organizational challenges in implementing AI projects are a result of a paradoxical tension created by two different perspectives on data science work: craft and mechanical work. Executives, managers, and data scientists should actively manage this tension to enable and sustain value creation through AI.

AB \Personality describes an individual's internal attributes, encompassing distinctive thoughts, emotions, and behaviour. Various studies have been undertaken to quantify these personality traits using externally visible cues and measures. Despite the possibility of a disparity between the apparent and real personality traits, researchers have identified various deep learning techniques to measure the apparent personality as part of the ChaLearn Looking at People, ECCV challenge. We provide an overview of the different deep learning models used for apparent personality detection. The primary objective of previous studies was to develop highly accurate prediction models, and subsequently, the focus shifted towards interpreting the output of these techniques. Although explainable AI (XAI) techniques have shown that facial features are essential in predicting personality, the consistency of these results is still a critical factor to consider. Moreover, the majority of studies utilized the ECCV challenge CVPR'17 dataset to predict apparent personality; therefore, there is a requirement to validate these findings through additional datasets. In conclusion, ample scope exists for further research in the domain of personality detection that can yield highly accurate and more interpretable models.

DT Article; Early Access
AB Severe nonradiative recombination and energy level mismatch in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are key factors affecting efficiency. Here, we report an effective strategy for surface passivation and interfacial dipole engineering of perovskite films. By precisely introducing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups on 7-azaindole, we have effectively controlled the passivation ability of N atoms and the polarity of the interfacial dipole, thereby regulating the perovskite surface's work function and obtaining the optimal energy level matching. This strategy yields an impressive efficiency of 10.76% for the CsPbBr3 PSC and exceptional stability.
   Different functional groups on 7-azaindole (7-AI) alter its passivation ability and dipole moment. Finally, 7-AI-OCH3 proves to be highly effective in passivating defects and optimizing energy level alignment.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) systems, as critical components of the power grid, have become increasingly reliant on standard Information Technology (IT) computing and network infrastructure for their operation and maintenance. However, this dependency exposes PV systems to heightened vulnerabilities and the risk of cyber-attacks. In recent times, the number of reported cyber-attacks targeting PV systems has increased significantly. This paper provides an overview of the cybersecurity challenges faced by PV systems, emphasizing their susceptibility to anomalies and cyber threats. It highlights the urgency of implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect the integrity and reliability of PV installations. By understanding and addressing these challenges, stakeholders can ensure the resilience and secure integration of PV systems within the power grid infrastructure.

Thus, our objective was rooted in analyzing the pros and cons of ChatGPT use and how it can be exploited and used by urologists.Recent findingsChatGPT can facilitate clinical documentation and note-taking, patient communication and support, medical education, and research. In urology, it was proven that ChatGPT has the potential as a virtual healthcare aide for benign prostatic hyperplasia, an educational and prevention tool on prostate cancer, educational support for urological residents, and as an assistant in writing urological papers and academic work. However, several concerns about its exploitation are presented, such as lack of web crawling, risk of accidental plagiarism, and concerns about patients-data privacy.SummaryThe existing limitations mediate the need for further improvement of ChatGPT, such as ensuring the privacy of patient data and expanding the learning dataset to include medical databases, and developing guidance on its appropriate use. Urologists can also help by conducting studies to determine the effectiveness of ChatGPT in urology in clinical scenarios and nosologies other than those previously listed.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Real-time detection and alert systems for distracted driving are pivotal areas of research. With Edge AI, it is feasible to process data in real-time without relying on Internet connectivity, thereby safeguarding user privacy. However, the computational and storage constraints of edge devices can hamper the deployment of deep learning models, such as VGG-16. In response, we introduce a framework tailored for distracted driving detection using an ensemble model. This model taps into the potential of lightweight pre-trained networks like Inception, Xception, DenseNet, and MobileNet. Our objective is to amalgamate these models to achieve high accuracy, low latency, and fewer parameter set. Experiments on the State Farm dataset reveal a remarkable 99% accuracy rate, underlining its viability for devices with limited resources, such as the Nvidia Jetson Nano. These results underscore the efficacy and feasibility of our framework in the realm of edge computing.

AB Background: Currently, health care is expert-centric, especially with regard to decision-making. Innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) or interconnected electronic health records (EHRs) suffer from low adoption rates. In the rare cases of technically successful implementation, they often result in inefficient or error-prone processes. Aim & Methods: This paper explores the state of the art in AI-based digital decision support systems (DDSSs). To overcome the low adoption rates, we propose a systematic strategy for bringing DDSS research into clinical practice based on a design science approach. DDSSs can transform health care to be more innovative, patientcentric, accurate and efficient. We contribute by providing a framework for the successful development, evaluation and analysis of systems for AI-based decision-making. This framework is then evaluated using focus group interviews. Results: Centred around our framework, we define a systematic approach for the use of AI in health care. Our systematic AI support approach highlights essential perspectives on DDSSs for systematic development and analysis. The aim is to develop and promote robust and optimal practices for clinical investigation and evaluation of DDSS in order to encourage their adoption rates. The framework contains the following dimensions: disease, data, technology, user groups, validation, decision and maturity. Conclusion: DDSSs focusing on only one framework dimension are generally not successful; therefore, we propose to consider each framework dimension during analysis, design, implementation and evaluation so as to raise the number of DDSSs used in clinical practice. Public Interest Summary: The digital transformation of the healthcare sector creates the potential for the sector to be more accurate, efficient and patient-centric using AI, or so-called digital decision support systems. In this research, we explore why these systems are needed and how they can be successfully implemented in clinical practice. For this, we propose a systematic approach based on our conceptual framework. Against this background, we present our vision for further advancing these technologies. We see our systematic AI support as a primary driver, with the possibility to facilitate the much-needed breakthrough of decision support systems in health care.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) models are promising to improve the accuracy of wireless positioning systems, particularly in indoor environments where unpredictable radio propagation channel is a great challenge. Although great efforts have been made to explore the effectiveness of different AI models, it is still an open problem whether these models, trained with the data collected from all base stations (BSs), could work when some BSs are unavailable. In this paper, we make the first effort to enhance the generalization ability of AI wireless positioning model to adapt to the scenario where only partial BSs work. Particularly, a Siamese Network based Wireless Positioning Model (SNWPM) is proposed to predict the location of mobile user equipment from channel state information (CSI) collected from 5G BSs. Furthermore, a Feature Aware Attention Module (FAAM) is introduced to reinforce the capability of feature extraction from CSI data. Experiments are conducted on the 2022 Wireless Communication AI Competition (WAIC) dataset. The proposed SNWPM achieves decimeter-level positioning accuracy even if the data of partial BSs are unavailable. Compared with other AI models, the proposed SNWPM can reduce the positioning error by nearly 50% to more than 60% while using less parameters and lower computation resources.

AB Background MRI is the routine examination to surveil the recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but it has relatively lower sensitivity than PET/CT. We aimed to find if artificial intelligence (AI) could be competent pre inspector for MRI radiologists and whether AI-aided MRI could perform better or even equal to PET/CT.Methods This multicenter study enrolled 6916 patients from five hospitals between September 2009 and October 2020. A 2.5D convolutional neural network diagnostic model and a nnU-Net contouring model were developed in the training and test cohorts and used to independently predict and visualize the recurrence of patients in the internal and external validation cohorts. We evaluated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of AI and compared AI with MRI and PET/CT in sensitivity and specificity using the McNemar test. The prospective cohort was randomized into the AI and non-AI groups, and their sensitivity and specificity were compared using the Chi-square test.Findings The AI model achieved AUCs of 0.92 and 0.88 in the internal and external validation cohorts, corresponding to the sensitivity of 79.5% and 74.3% and specificity of 91.0% and 92.8%. It had comparable sensitivity to MRI (e.g., 74.3% vs. 74.7%, P = 0.89) but lower sensitivity than PET/CT (77.9% vs. 92.0%, P < 0.0001) at the same individual specificities. The AI model achieved moderate precision with a median dice similarity coefficient of 0.67. AI-aided MRI improved specificity (92.5% vs. 85.0%, P = 0.034), equaled PET/CT in the internal validation subcohort, and increased sensitivity (81.9% vs. 70.8%, P = 0.021) in the external validation subcohort. In the prospective cohort of 1248 patients, the AI group had higher sensitivity than the non-AI group (78.6% vs. 67.3%, P = 0.23), albeit nonsignificant. In future randomized controlled trials, a sample size of 3943 patients in each arm would be required to demonstrate the statistically significant difference.Interpretation The AI model equaled MRI by expert radiologists, and AI-aided MRI by expert radiologists equaled PET/CT. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted to demonstrate the AI's benefit sufficiently.

AB Background. Artificial intelligence (AI) can aid in the diagnosis and treatment planning of periodontal disease by means of reducing subjectivity. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of AI models in detecting radiographic periodontal bone loss (PBL) and accuracy in classifying lesions. Types of Studies Reviewed. The authors conducted an electronic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published through August 2022. Articles evaluating the efficacy of AI in determining PBL were included. The authors assessed the articles using the Quality Assessment for Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy tool. They used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria to evaluate the certainty of evidence. Results. Of the 13 articles identified through electronic search, 6 studies met the inclusion criteria, using a variety of AI algorithms and different modalities, including panoramic and intraoral radiographs. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and pixel accuracy were the outcomes measured. Although some studies found no substantial difference between AI and dental clinicians' performance, others showed AI's superiority in detecting PBL. Evidence suggests that AI has the potential to aid in the detection of PBL and classification of periodontal diseases. However, further research is needed to standardize AI algorithms and validate their clinical usefulness. Practical Implications. Although the use of AI may offer some benefits in the detection and classification of periodontal diseases, the low level of evidence and the inconsistent performance of AI algorithms suggest that caution should be exercised when considering the use of AI models in diagnosing PBL. This review was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42022364600).

TI Pan-mediastinal neoplasm diagnosis via nationwide federated learning: a
   multicentre cohort study
SO LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID LUNG-CANCER; LESIONS; TUMORS; CT
AB Background Mediastinal neoplasms are typical thoracic diseases with increasing incidence in the general global population and can lead to poor prognosis. In clinical practice, the mediastinum's complex anatomic structures and intertype confusion among different mediastinal neoplasm pathologies severely hinder accurate diagnosis. To solve these difficulties, we organised a multicentre national collaboration on the basis of privacy-secured federated learning and developed CAIMEN, an efficient chest CT-based artificial intelligence (AI) mediastinal neoplasm diagnosis system. Methods In this multicentre cohort study, 7825 mediastinal neoplasm cases and 796 normal controls were collected from 24 centres in China to develop CAIMEN. We further enhanced CAIMEN with several novel algorithms in a multiview, knowledge-transferred, multilevel decision-making pattern. CAIMEN was tested by internal (929 cases at 15 centres), external (1216 cases at five centres and a real-world cohort of 11 162 cases), and human-AI (60 positive cases from four centres and radiologists from 15 institutions) test sets to evaluate its detection, segmentation, and classification performance. Findings In the external test experiments, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting mediastinal neoplasms of CAIMEN was 0 & BULL;973 (95% CI 0 & BULL;969-0 & BULL;977). In the real-world cohort, CAIMEN detected 13 false-negative cases confirmed by radiologists. The dice score for segmenting mediastinal neoplasms of CAIMEN was 0 & BULL;765 (0 & BULL;738-0 & BULL;792). The mediastinal neoplasm classification top-1 and top-3 accuracy of CAIMEN were 0 & BULL;523 (0 & BULL;497-0 & BULL;554) and 0 & BULL;799 (0 & BULL;778-0 & BULL;822), respectively. In the human-AI test experiments, CAIMEN outperformed clinicians with top-1 and top-3 accuracy of 0 & BULL;500 (0 & BULL;383-0 & BULL;633) and 0 & BULL;800 (0 & BULL;700-0 & BULL;900), respectively. Meanwhile, with assistance from the computer aided diagnosis software based on CAIMEN, the 46 clinicians improved their average top-1 accuracy by 19 & BULL;1% (0 & BULL;345-0 & BULL;411) and top-3 accuracy by 13 & BULL;0% (0 & BULL;545-0 & BULL;616). Interpretation For mediastinal neoplasms, CAIMEN can produce high diagnostic accuracy and assist the diagnosis of human experts, showing its potential for clinical practice.

AB Estimation of reservoir properties from seismic data suffers from non-unique solutions. A workflow based on the numerical reformulation of a laboratory-based rock physics model may reduce the non-uniqueness. This study attempts to integrate seismic and well log data of relatively unexplored parts of Upper Assam (UA) basin using inversion driven by laboratory based rock physics model. The laboratory-based rock physics model was developed based on experimental measurements conducted on rock cores from Tipam and Barail formations of the basin. Seismic inversion analysis was performed in OpendTect, an open-source software on post-stack seismic data to derive the acoustic impedance (AI) using coloured inversion. A multilayered feed-forward neural network was developed to spatially populate different petrophysical properties. Laboratory-based correlations between AI, density, porosity were utilised for the AI model from which velocity was computed using multivariate rock physics equation. This derived velocity value was transformed to AI and subsequently trained with well log to populate density (2.23-2.73 gm/cc) and porosity (7-28%) for the entire survey area. A reasonable to high correlation is obtained between bulk density and porosity derived by NN using well log and that derived by laboratory-based model (r = 0.78, 0.91 for Barail and 0.95, 0.94 for Sylhet formation). Thus, integrating datasets of different scale from seismic to core with well log data using neural network helps to derive more realistic models that helps in quantitative decision analysis.

AB Geospatial datasets derived from remote sensing data by means of machine learning methods are often based on probabilistic outputs of abstract nature, which are difficult to translate into interpretable measures. For example, the Global Human Settlement Layer GHS-BUILT-S2 product reports the probability of the presence of built-up areas in 2018 in a global 10 m x 10 m grid. However, practitioners typically require interpretable measures such as binary surfaces indicating the presence or absence of built-up areas or estimates of sub-pixel built-up surface fractions. Herein, we assess the relationship between the built-up probability in GHS-BUILT-S2 and reference built-up surface fractions derived from a highly reliable reference database for several regions in the United States. Furthermore, we identify a binarization threshold using an agreement maximization method that creates binary built-up land data from these built-up probabilities. These binary surfaces are input to a spatially explicit, scale-sensitive accuracy assessment which includes the use of a novel, visual-analytical tool which we call focal precision-recall signature plots. Our analysis reveals that a threshold of 0.5 applied to GHS-BUILT-S2 maximizes the agreement with binarized built-up land data derived from the reference built-up area fraction. We find high levels of accuracy (i.e., county-level F-1 scores of almost 0.8 on average) in the derived built-up areas, and consistently high accuracy along the rural-urban gradient in our study area. These results reveal considerable accuracy improvements in human settlement models based on Sentinel-2 data and deep learning, as compared to earlier, Landsat-based versions of the Global Human Settlement Layer.

AB Fuel consumption prediction (FCP) of vessels is the core of many decarbonization efforts by the maritime industry. Understanding the capability of machine learning (ML) FCP models is essential in various decision-making processes. However, the current model testing practice does not reflect their uncertainty and resilience in actual applications. To address this gap, this study proposes a testing regime that could provide insights into models' behaviors, dependency on different features, and potential vulnerabilities to data uncertainties in the deployment phase. Two multi-ship FCP models were developed for testing, using extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms on noon reports of a container fleet operated globally in 2.5 years. Unlike previous studies, which explicitly indicated the superior ML algorithms, results from this study depicted a complicated situation with no decisive dominance of one algorithm over another, suggesting the potential of model combination and cooperation for optimal application performance. Aiding the FCP model development efforts, this study also includes findings regarding (1) the optimal configurations for ANN models, and (2) the reliance of FCP ML models and algorithms on different fuel consumption influencing factors. To our knowledge, this study is among the first to advocate a more comprehensive understanding of AI-based FCP models' characteristics in realistic scenarios instead of simple selections based on accuracy indicators.

AB Objective: The scarcity of artificial intelligence (AI) applications designed for use in pediatric patients can cause a significant health disparity in this vulnerable population. We investigated the performance of an adult-trained algorithm in detecting pneumonia in a pediatric population to explore the viability of leveraging adult-trained algorithms to accelerate pediatric AI research.Methods: We analyzed a publicly available pediatric chest x-ray dataset using an AI algorithm from TorchXRayVision. A 60% threshold was used to make binary predictions for pneumonia presence. Predictions were compared with dataset labels. Performance measures including true-positive rate, false-positive rate, true-negative rate, false-negative rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, accuracy, and F1-score were calculated for the complete dataset and bacterial and viral pneumonia subsets.Results: Overall (n 1/4 5,856), the algorithm identified 3,923 cases with pneumonia (67.00%) and 1,933 (33.00%) normal cases. In comparison with the actual image labels, there were 3,411 (58.25%) true-positive cases, 512 (8.74%) false-positive cases, 1,071 (18.29%) true-negative cases, and 862 (14.72%) false-negative cases resulting in 79.83% sensitivity, 67.66% specificity, 86.95% PPV, 55.41% negative predictive value, and 76.54% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.83. Although the performance remained consistent in the bacterial pneumonia group, there was a significant decrease in PPV (69.9%) and F1-score (0.74) in the viral pneumonia group.Conclusion: An adult-trained model adequately detected pneumonia in pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years. Though models trained exclusively on pediatric images performed better, leveraging adult-based algorithms and datasets can expedite pediatric AI research.

AB ObjectivesTo map the clinical use of CE-marked artificial intelligence (AI)-based software in radiology departments in the Netherlands (n = 69) between 2020 and 2022.Materials and methodsOur AI network (one radiologist or AI representative per Dutch hospital organization) received a questionnaire each spring from 2020 to 2022 about AI product usage, financing, and obstacles to adoption. Products that were not listed on www.AIforRadiology.com by July 2022 were excluded from the analysis.ResultsThe number of respondents was 43 in 2020, 36 in 2021, and 33 in 2022. The number of departments using AI has been growing steadily (2020: 14, 2021: 19, 2022: 23). The diversity (2020: 7, 2021: 18, 2022: 34) and the number of total implementations (2020: 19, 2021: 38, 2022: 68) has rapidly increased. Seven implementations were discontinued in 2022. Four hospital organizations said to use an AI platform or marketplace for the deployment of AI solutions. AI is mostly used to support chest CT (17), neuro CT (17), and musculoskeletal radiograph (12) analysis. The budget for AI was reserved in 13 of the responding centers in both 2021 and 2022. The most important obstacles to the adoption of AI remained costs and IT integration. Of the respondents, 28% stated that the implemented AI products realized health improvement and 32% assumed both health improvement and cost savings.ConclusionThe adoption of AI products in radiology departments in the Netherlands is showing common signs of a developing market. The major obstacles to reaching widespread adoption are a lack of financial resources and IT integration difficulties.Clinical relevance statementThe clinical impact of AI starts with its adoption in daily clinical practice. Increased transparency around AI products being adopted, implementation obstacles, and impact may inspire increased collaboration and improved decision-making around the implementation and financing of AI products.Key Points & BULL; The adoption of artificial intelligence products for radiology has steadily increased since 2020 to at least a third of the centers using AI in clinical practice in the Netherlands in 2022.& BULL; The main areas in which artificial intelligence products are used are lung nodule detection on CT, aided stroke diagnosis, and bone age prediction.& BULL; The majority of respondents experienced added value (decreased costs and/or improved outcomes) from using artificial intelligence-based software; however, major obstacles to adoption remain the costs and IT-related difficulties.Key Points & BULL; The adoption of artificial intelligence products for radiology has steadily increased since 2020 to at least a third of the centers using AI in clinical practice in the Netherlands in 2022.& BULL; The main areas in which artificial intelligence products are used are lung nodule detection on CT, aided stroke diagnosis, and bone age prediction.& BULL; The majority of respondents experienced added value (decreased costs and/or improved outcomes) from using artificial intelligence-based software; however, major obstacles to adoption remain the costs and IT-related difficulties.Key Points & BULL; The adoption of artificial intelligence products for radiology has steadily increased since 2020 to at least a third of the centers using AI in clinical practice in the Netherlands in 2022.& BULL; The main areas in which artificial intelligence products are used are lung nodule detection on CT, aided stroke diagnosis, and bone age prediction.

AB Physical exercise is an essential component of rehabilitation programs that improve quality of life and reduce mortality and re-hospitalization rates. In AI-driven virtual rehabilitation programs, patients complete their exercises independently at home, while AI algorithms analyze the exercise data to provide feedback to patients and report their progress to clinicians. To analyze exercise data, the first step is to segment it into consecutive repetitions. There has been a significant amount of research performed on segmenting and counting the repetitive activities of healthy individuals using raw video data, which raises concerns regarding privacy and is computationally intensive. Previous research on patients' rehabilitation exercise segmentation relied on data collected by multiple wearable sensors, which are difficult to use at home by rehabilitation patients. Compared to healthy individuals, segmenting and counting exercise repetitions in patients is more challenging because of the irregular repetition duration and the variation between repetitions. This paper presents a novel approach for segmenting and counting the repetitions of rehabilitation exercises performed by patients, based on their skeletal body joints. Skeletal body joints can be acquired through depth cameras or computer vision techniques applied to RGB videos of patients. Various sequential neural networks, including many-to-many models (with binary sequence output and density map output) and many-to-one models (with a single output), are designed to analyze the sequences of skeletal body joints and perform repetition segmentation and counting. Extensive experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise datasets, KIMORE, UI-PRMD, and IntelliRehabDS, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods. The proposed method enables accurate exercise analysis while preserving privacy, facilitating the effective delivery of virtual rehabilitation programs.

AB Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have paved the way for the development of new generations of self-adaptive systems that embed learning behaviours. Often these systems make use of Machine Learning (ML) models and algorithms, others make use of symbolic reasoning, or a combination of the two. A problem common to all these solutions is the difficulty in establishing clear conformance criteria that can be used to reliably assess whether an AI-based software system (and, in particular, ML-based) is behaving as intended, i.e., according to its specification. Research communities from different areas are investigating innovative V&V approaches in order to assess evolving AI systems against their expected functionalities. This empirical study identifies, collects and categorises relevant research papers on testing and formal verification of AI-based software systems. In total, we have considered a set of 78 fully qualified primary studies from the digital library Scopus. For each of them, we have mapped their key aspects into a classification framework that supports their comparison across a set of common dimensions.

AB Anomaly Detection (AD) is a popular unsupervised learning technique, but AD implementations are difficult to test, understand, and ultimately improve. Contributing factors for these difficulties include the lack of a specification to test against, output differences (on the same input) between toolkits that supposedly implement the same AD algorithm, and no linkage between learning parameters and undesirable outcomes. We have implemented DEANOMALYZER, a black-box tool that improves AD reliability by addressing two issues: nondeterminism (wide output variations across repeated runs of the same implementation on the same dataset) and inconsistency (wide output variations between toolkits on the same dataset). Specifically, DEANOMALYZER uses a feedback-directed, gradient descent-like approach to search for toolkit parameter settings that maximize determinism and consistency. DEANOMALYZER can operate in two modes: univariate, without ground truth, targeted to general users, and bivariate, with ground truth, targeted to algorithm designers and developers. We evaluated DEANOMALYZER on 54 AD datasets and the implementations of four AD algorithms in three popular ML toolkits: MATLAB, R, and Scikit-learn. The evaluation has revealed that DEANOMALYZER is effective at increasing determinism and consistency without sacrificing performance, and can even improve performance.

DE Test Prioritization Algorithms; Evaluation Metrics; Severity
   Prioritization; Effective Labeling
AB Recently, there has been a growing trend in AI testing toward developing new test prioritization algorithms for deep learning systems. These algorithms aim to reduce the cost and time needed to annotate test datasets by prioritizing instances with a higher chance of exposing faults. Various metrics have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms, e.g., APFD, RAUC, and ATRC. However, there is a lack of research to confirm their validity. The results indicate that the existing metrics have severe limitations. For example, some metrics ignore the labeling budget and prioritize the fault detection rate instead of the fault detection ratio. Moreover, others overlook the prioritization difficulty in the evaluation.
   As a solution, we develop a new metric (WFDR), which solves the deficiencies of previous metrics. We also draw attention to a new research area, known as severity prioritization, which emphasizes the importance of prioritizing misclassified instances according to the severity level, particularly in critical situations. Our experiments reveal that instances with high severity make up more than 20% of all misclassified instances. Thus, these instances should be prioritized when it comes to labeling. Consequently, we proposed a new metric known as (SFDR) that evaluates the effectiveness of algorithms in prioritizing high-severity instances. Our evaluations show that our proposed metrics are more effective than other existing metrics. Besides, our two metrics re-evaluate some recent algorithms and indicate that these algorithms perform poorly.

AB This paper introduces testFAILS, an innovative testing framework designed for the rigorous evaluation of AI Linguistic Systems, with a particular emphasis on various iterations of ChatGPT. Leveraging orthogonal array coverage, this framework provides a robust mechanism for assessing AI systems, addressing the critical question, "How should we evaluate AI?" While the Turing test has traditionally been the benchmark for AI evaluation, we argue that current publicly available chatbots, despite their rapid advancements, have yet to meet this standard. However, the pace of progress suggests that achieving Turing test-level performance may be imminent. In the interim, the need for effective AI evaluation and testing methodologies remains paramount. Our research, which is ongoing, has already validated several versions of ChatGPT, and we are currently conducting comprehensive testing on the latest models, including ChatGPT-4, Bard, Bing Bot, and the LLaMA model. The testFAILS framework is designed to be adaptable, ready to evaluate new bot versions as they are released. Additionally, we have tested available chatbot APIs and developed our own application, AIDoctor, utilizing the ChatGPT-4 model and Microsoft Azure AI technologies.

AB This paper presents Alfred, a web-based artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot powered by the Rasa framework and designed to facilitate Agile software release planning by using two machine learning (ML) models to estimate the time for each task selected by the project managers and recommend the optimal resource to be assigned to each task. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used for time estimation, and the models performance evaluated using accuracy, adjusted coefficient of determination (R2), and fitting a line between the estimation and actual values. The results obtained were 82% accuracy and 98% adjusted R2 score. K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) is used for resource recommendation in a one-shot learning manner. The application integrates a dashboard with useful visualizations and an interactive smart assistant AI-based chatbot, providing project managers with a tool to make more informed decisions. Additionally, an approach is used to indicate the models confidence in tasks estimation of given tasks based on the amount of available data showing the history in the system to give project managers more insights. The approach uses a keywords frequency indication algorithm based on the summary tokens to group the task estimates into one of three categories of confidence: high, medium, or low.

AB Generally, the quality of artificial intelligence (AI) models depends on the training dataset. Therefore, evaluating dataset quality is crucial. Datasets contain considerable attribute information, and the presence of noise attributes in the dataset can result in inferior performance in tasks such as classification and object detection. Thus, the numerous attributes contained in the dataset have to be extracted, and attributes that affect the performance of an AI model, as well as the presence and quantity of data with those attributes, have to be identified to assess dataset quality. In this study, we proposed a visualization tool for the extraction of various attributes and corresponding data for dataset quality assessment (VisTEx) by using an existing unsupervised learning method, multi-facet clustering variational autoencoders (MFCVAE). The proposed visualization tool displays the features extracted by MFCVAE on a two-dimensional (2D) scatter plot. When the user selects a region on this scatterplot, the corresponding data are displayed. This enables users to efficiently extract data attributes. A set of data corresponding to the attributes can then be extracted. Because handwritten character datasets were used in the study, a group of data with common attributes, such as the line width of the characters and presence of ruled lines as well as the character type, were extracted. Data containing ruled line noise could be extracted with 99.40% precision and 99.96% recall.

AB As AI-based critical systems are expected to operate in dynamic environments, it is crucial to ensure their reliability under various operational conditions. In computer vision, one way to achieve this is by testing the system's robustness to input image perturbations. However, while many methods have been proposed and evaluated in academic settings, their effectiveness and applicability in practice remain largely unknown. In this paper, we report the results of testing the robustness of an industrial case of an AI-based road object detection system, in a black-box setting. By defining relevant perturbations and metrics, we analyse the system's response to changes in its hardware and software environment, and identify areas for improvement through retraining with data augmentation. We address the key challenges encountered during this evaluation and provide insights that may help practitioners in performing similar tests and guide future research on robustness testing of AI-based object detection systems.

AB Edge AI accelerators have gained popularity as a solution for applications such as image recognition sensors, remote sensing satellites, robotics, wearable devices, and drones due to their compact size and low power consumption. However, these applications demand fault tolerance, namely reliability, to overcome defects caused by radiation or manufacturing defects, especially in hard-to-reach environments like space or nuclear power stations. This paper presents an online permanent fault detection mechanism for streaming convolution engines in edge AI accelerators. The detection mechanism comprising extra comparison modules is added to a convolution engine's processing elements (PEs). The experiment results show low overhead of the fault detection mechanism's hardware resource and power consumption. The resource overheads are less than 3.6%, while the overhead of power consumption is not more than 1.2%.

AB This study investigated the potential of enhancing the performance of text classification by augmenting the training dataset with external knowledge samples generated by a generative AI, specifically ChatGPT. The study conducted experiments on three models - CNN, HiSAN, and BERT - using the Reuters dataset. First, the study evaluated the effectiveness of incorporating ChatGPT-generated samples and then analyzed the impact of various factors such as sample size, sample variability, and sample length on the models' performance by varying the number, variety, and length of the generated samples. The models were assessed using macro and micro-averaged scores, and the results revealed that the macro-averaged scores improved significantly across all three models, with the BERT model showing the greatest improvement (from 49.87% to 65.73% in macro F1 score). The study further found that adding 30 distinct samples produced better results than adding 6 duplicates of 5 samples, and samples with 150 and 256 words had similar performance, while those with 50 words performed slightly worse. These findings suggest that incorporating external knowledge samples generated by a generative AI is an effective approach to enhance text classification models' performance. The study also highlights that the variability of articles generated by ChatGPT positively impacted the models' accuracy, and longer synthesized texts convey more comprehensive information on the subjects, leading to higher classification accuracy scores. Additionally, we conducted a comparison between our results and those obtained from EDA, a widely used data augmentation generator. The findings clearly demonstrate that our method surpasses EDA and offers additional advantages by reducing computational costs and solving zero-shot problem. Our code is available on GitHub.(1)

AB Cognitive science related research offers valuable knowledge for the design, development, and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this short position paper, leveraging first principles from cognitive science, we propose novel methods for testing pre-trained large language models (LLMs), specifically to assess their common sense reasoning abilities. The test cases are meant to aid in assessing the model's ability 1) to analyze various dimensions of a prototype, and 2) to discover subtle and implied meanings (e.g. proverbs) across languages. We hope the ideas presented in the paper will spark interdisciplinary discussions concerning robust audit and evaluation of LLMs.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in revolutionizing the field of digital health by improving disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. This paper describes the Health Guardian platform, a non-commercial, scientific research-based platform developed by the IBM Digital Health team to rapidly translate AI research into cloud-based microservices. The platform can collect health-related data from various digital devices, including wearables and mobile applications. Its flexible architecture supports microservices that accept diverse data types such as text, audio, and video, expanding the range of digital health assessments and enabling holistic health evaluations by capturing voice, facial, and motion bio-signals. These microservices can be deployed to a clinical cohort specified through the Clinical Task Manager (CTM). The CTM then collects multi-modal, clinical data that can iteratively improve the accuracy of AI predictive models, discover new disease mechanisms, or identify novel biomarkers. This paper highlights three microservices with different input data types, including a text-based microservice for depression assessment, a video-based microservice for sit-to-stand mobility assessment, and a wearable-based microservice for functional mobility assessment. The CTM is also discussed as a tool to help design and set up clinical studies to unlock the full potential of the platform. Today, the Health Guardian platform is being leveraged in collaboration with research partners to optimize the development of AI models by utilizing a multitude of input sources. This approach streamlines research efforts, enhances efficiency, and facilitates the development and validation of digital health applications.

AB This paper presents a data-centric and security-focused data fabric designed for digital health applications. With the increasing interest in digital health research, there has been a surge in the volume of Internet of Things (IoT) data derived from smartphones, wearables, and ambient sensors. Managing this vast amount of data, encompassing diverse data types and varying time scales, is crucial. Moreover, compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations is essential. The proposed data fabric comprises an architecture and a toolkit that facilitate the integration of heterogeneous data sources, across different environments, to provide a unified view of the data in dashboards. Furthermore, the data fabric supports the development of reusable and configurable data integration components, which can be shared as open-source or inner-source software. These components are used to generate data pipelines that can be deployed and scheduled to run either in the cloud or on-premises. Additionally, we present the implementation of our data fabric in a home-based telemonitoring research project involving older adults, conducted in collaboration with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The study showcases the streamlined integration of data collected from various IoT sensors and mobile applications to create a unified view of older adults' health for further analysis and research.

AB Deep Learning for Time-series plays a key role in AI for healthcare. To predict the progress of infectious disease outbreaks and demonstrate clear population-level impact, more granular analyses are urgently needed that control for important and potentially confounding county-level socioeconomic and health factors. We forecast US county-level COVID-19 infections using the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). We focus on heterogeneous time-series deep learning model prediction while interpreting the complex spatiotemporal features learned from the data. The significance of the work is grounded in a real-world COVID-19 infection prediction with highly non-stationary, finely granular, and heterogeneous data. 1) Our model can capture the detailed daily changes of temporal and spatial model behaviors and achieves better prediction performance compared to other time-series models. 2) We analyzed the attention patterns from TFT to interpret the temporal and spatial patterns learned by the model. 3) We collected around 2.5 years of socioeconomic and health features for 3142 US counties, such as observed cases, and a number of static (age distribution and health disparity) and dynamic features (vaccination, disease spread, transmissible cases, and social distancing). Using the proposed framework, we have shown that our model can learn complex interactions. Interpreting different impacts at the county level would be crucial for understanding the infection process that can help effective public health decision-making.

AB The global rise in deaths caused by pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has placed increased pressure on overburdened healthcare systems to provide TB diagnostic services. Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided diagnosis (AI-based CAD) promises to be a powerful tool in responding to this health challenge by providing actionable outputs which support the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of clinicians. However, these technologies must first be extensively evaluated to understand their impact and risks before pursuing wide-scale deployment. Yet, health technology assessments for them in real world settings have been limited. Comprehensive evaluation demands consideration of technical safety, human factors, and health impacts to generate robust evidence and understand what is needed for long-term sustainable benefit realisation. This work-in progress study presents a three-stage methodological approach that will be used to guide the data collection and analysis process for evaluating the impact of implementing a commercial AI-based CAD system for TB diagnosis in a real-world radiological setting.

AB One of the most appealing challenges, especially in mobile robotics, is the real-time inferencing of the vision data offloaded from a mobile robot for its enhanced navigation performance. Leveraging the benefits of an on-premise and an integrated fog-cloud computing platform for processing vision data is a viable solution. This paper addresses the mentioned challenge via a data-driven control approach for the development of an autonomic fog-cloud computing platform suitable for processing the offloaded vision data within a prescribed time bound called the service time. The approach comprises developing a data-driven linear parameter varying (LPV) framework for modeling and design of a model predictive controller (MPC) for the fog and the cloud platforms independently. A heuristic algorithm performs the distribution of the mobile robot vision data (MRVD) between the fog and the cloud platforms. The LPV model for the fog and the cloud platforms are developed by characterizing the MRVD as the variable frame rate and resolution of the objects (under active consideration in a given frame) acquired during navigation. We validate the developed theory for a mobile robot while navigating in the application environment such as the warehouse. The experimental results presented for object detection under service time bounds show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Although there has been some progress, the integration of artificial intelligence into higher education remains far from sufficient. The demand for teachers will persist for some time; however, with the introduction of AI-based robots into classrooms, the role of teachers has been reduced to a minimum. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate Chinese higher education students' intentions to adopt AI-based robots for educational purposes. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 3 model, the current study proposes 14 hypotheses to evaluate students' intention to adopt AI-based robots in education. The students' data were collected and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The study findings revealed that 12 hypotheses were accepted and two were rejected. The results indicate that students are willing to accept AI-based robots in their education. However, the findings revealed an insignificant influence of job relevance and robot anxiety on perceived usefulness and ease of use, respectively. The findings of this study will provide insight into university administrations regarding the significance of AI-based robots in education. Moreover, the findings will help robot developers, policymakers, and university administrators design and implement AI-based robots that fulfill contemporary education needs.

AB This paper introduces an innovative model for precise extraction of lung nodules from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans. Our approach comprises two essential preprocessing stages aimed at refining search accuracy and nodule segmentation. Initially, we leverage a two-level joint Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) model to delineate the lung region, effectively distinguishing lung wall nodules from the chest region with shared visual characteristics. Subsequently, employing a deep learning U-net technique, we pinpoint the region of interest (ROI) housing the lung nodule, minimizing the inclusion of surrounding lung tissues. Further enhancement comes from a 3D U-net, trained with a novel loss function to mitigate under- or over-segmentation issues. The resulting segmentation robustly outlines lung nodules in terms of morphology and volume metrics, validated by Dice coefficient (DCE), absolute volume difference (AVD), 95th -percentile Hausdorff distance (HD), sensitivity, and specificity metrics. To assess our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments. Our evaluation encompasses in vivo data from 50 patients and employs 679 subjects from the publicly available dataset of the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI). The LIDC-IDRI dataset, a seminal resource for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in lung nodules, offers annotations enabling tasks like detection, segmentation, classification, and quantification. Our experiments showcase our model's superiority over existing deep learning methods, particularly evident in metrics such as the 95th -percentile HD and DCE. While limited demographic information constrains a comprehensive analysis, our approach's robust performance underlines its potential integration into nodule assessment AI systems.

AB Purpose: Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HA-ART) can effectively suppress the disease process in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), opportunistic infections, mainly bloodstream infections (BSI), are still the main cause of death in people living with HIV. There is no effective diagnostic strategy for HIV-infected people with BSI. This study aimed to develop an AI diagnostic model with high sensitivity to improve the early detection of HIV-infected people with BSI.Patients and Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the 40 clinical factors of 498 HIV-infected people (171 with BSI positive and 327 with BSI negative) who admitted to Wenzhou Central Hospital from September 2014 to July 2021. This study used the hospital information management system to collect the clinical characteristics, laboratory and imaging examination results, and clinical diagnosis of the two groups. The diagnostic results of all patients were in line with the diagnostic criteria of the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of AIDS (2021 Edition), and the BSI diagnosis was in line with the diagnostic criteria of sepsis and bacteremia in Practical Internal Medicine (13th Edition). On this basis, various risk prediction models were established by combining 8 artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the training set and validating the diagnosis performance in the testing set. The model with the best diagnostic performance was selected as the final diagnostic model.Results: The clinical characteristics of HIV-infected people with BSI are atypical, and the pathogens in this area are mainly fungi. Ten risk factors were selected: low level of hemoglobin, CD4+T cell and platelets, high level of lactate dehydrogenase and blood urea nitrogen, splenomegaly, without ART treatment, strip shadow, nodular shadow, and shock. The combination of the ten risk factors, age, gender and the "svmRadial" model can identify the HIV-infected people with BSI from the HIV-infected people without BSI with an area under the curve of 0.916 and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.824 and 0.855, respectively.Conclusion: The model showed excellent performance in diagnosing HIV-infected people with BSI. Internal and external validation showed that the diagnosis model had high clinical application value.

AB Recent advances in state-of-the-art camera-based AI mechanisms in the automated driving field have leveraged great progress in the installation and widespread use of this technology along the recent years. However, vehicles with automated driving capabilities are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors that complement the perception capacity of camera-based AI algorithms. For this reason, this paper tries to reveal the degree of readiness of one of the most used open-source AI models for Level 2 automated driving. To this end, a set of simulated common driving scenarios were used to evaluate the predictions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the current capacity of this camera-based DNN model is not sufficient to be the only source of information in the process of environment perception of a Level 2 automated vehicle, and therefore, further progress in the context awareness needs to be achieved to consider its sole use in the perception stage.

AB Video streaming is the leading network traffic on the Internet, yet there are few tools to run high fidelity experiments with video streaming traffic on network emulation-based testbeds. In this paper, we present a framework to enable higher fidelity and principled experimentation with 36 different video streaming traffic scenario combinations that can be configured and deployed on a notional CDN and data metrics infrastructure. This framework can be used to further study and experiment with adaptive bitrate algorithms and other AI/ML solutions for video delivery.

AB AI-enabled technology, such as digital voice assistants (VA), affects employees collaborating with it. This study, first, examines employees' perceptions of autonomy, organizational support, and psychological costs when receiving help either from an AI-enabled VA, a human co-worker, or a conventional computer (technology). Second, it analyzes the effects of these perceptions on job satisfaction. In a between-subjects online vignette experiment, 225 student participants assessed a fictitious yet realistic workplace situation of a side job where they received the same help from one of the three sources. Participants collaborating with the VA or the human co-worker reported less autonomy and more psychological costs than the group collaborating with conventional technology. Regarding perceived organizational support, participants perceived the VA and the computer as more similar to each other: Receiving help from the VA or the computer led to less perceived organizational support, compared to receiving help from a human co-worker. Further, autonomy and organizational support were significantly related to job satisfaction. Results show that the different help-sources exert distinct indirect effects on job satisfaction, mediated by differing perceptions of autonomy and organizational support. The findings have important implications for organizations' understanding of how introducing new technologies may influence employees' perceived job satisfaction.

AB The remarkable growth of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), has triggered a significant debate in society. It has the potential to radically transform the business landscape, with consequences for operations and supply chain management (O & SCM). However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI's effects in O & SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O & SCM. We collected data from O & SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ ChatGPT in O & SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters. Adopters also display diverse behavioral patterns toward efficiency, agility, responsiveness, etc. This study provides valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in comprehending Gen-AI/ChatGPT's implications in O & SCM for both adopters and non-adopters. Additionally, it underscores the importance of organizational learning processes in facilitating successful Gen-AI/ChatGPT adoption in O & SCM.

   SINGLE; MODEL
AB Solar Stills (SSs) are an eco-friendly and efficient approach to generating drinking water from brackish or saline sources. In this paper, a novel model for predicting the productivity of Hemispherical SS is proposed. This model enhances traditional MLP using an advanced Genetic Algorithm (GA), which mimics the process of "seeded selection" in natural selection to determine optimal MLP parameters. The resulting model, named Enhanced Genetic Algorithm - Multi-Layer Perceptron (EGA-MLP), is compared against two other models, standalone MLP and Particle Swarm Optimization with MLP (PSO-MLP), as well as experimental results from SSs. The models were applied to predict the yield of three different SS designs, including Conventional Hemispherical Still Without Fins (CHSWF), Cylindrical Finned Hemispherical Still (CyFHS), and Conical Finned Hemispherical Still (CoFHS), under varying environmental conditions and fins spacing. Statistical criteria such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used to assess the models' performance. The EGA-MLP model exhibits the highest R2 values across all tests, with an average R2 score of 0.994. In comparison, the PSO-MLP and MLP models achieve average R2 scores of 0.949 and 0.93, respectively. Furthermore, the EGA-MLP model demonstrates the lowest values of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) among the three models. The proposed model demonstrated the most accurate predictions of SS yield compared to both the experimental results and the other two models in predicting SS yield and has the potential to improve the design and optimization of SS systems.

AB PurposeIn spite of the merits of artificial intelligence (AI) in marketing and social media, harm to consumers has prompted calls for AI auditing/certification. Understanding consumers' approval of AI certification entities is vital for its effectiveness and companies' choice of certification. This study aims to generate important insights into the consumer perspective of AI certifications and stimulate future research.Design/methodology/approachA literature and status-quo-driven search of the AI certification landscape identifies entities and related concepts. This study empirically explores consumer approval of the most discussed entities in four AI decision domains using an online experiment and outline a research agenda for AI certification in marketing/social media.FindingsTrust in AI certification is complex. The empirical findings show that consumers seem to approve more of non-profit entities than for-profit entities, with the government approving the most.Research limitations/implicationsThe introduction of AI certification to marketing/social media contributes to work on consumer trust and AI acceptance and structures AI certification research from outside marketing to facilitate future research on AI certification for marketing/social media scholars.Practical implicationsFor businesses, the authors provide a first insight into consumer preferences for AI-certifying entities, guiding the choice of which entity to use. For policymakers, this work guides their ongoing discussion on "who should certify AI" from a consumer perspective.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to introduce the topic of AI certification to the marketing/social media literature, provide a novel guideline to scholars and offer the first set of empirical studies examining consumer approval of AI certifications.

In this comprehensive review of machine learning applications in the care of patients with diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk, we offer a broad overview of various data-driven methods and how they may be leveraged in developing predictive models for personalized care. We review existing as well as expected artificial intelligence solutions in the context of diagnosis, prognostication, phenotyping, and treatment of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. In addition to discussing the key properties of such models that enable their successful application in complex risk prediction, we define challenges that arise from their misuse and the role of methodological standards in overcoming these limitations. We also identify key issues in equity and bias mitigation in healthcare and discuss how the current regulatory framework should ensure the efficacy and safety of medical artificial intelligence products in transforming cardiovascular care and outcomes in diabetes.

AB Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems to aid diagnosis are increasingly being developed and implemented but with limited understanding of how such systems integrate with existing clinical work and organizational practices. We explored the early experiences of stakeholders using an AI-based imaging software tool Veye Lung Nodules (VLN) aiding the detection, classification, and measurement of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography scans of the chest.Materials and methods We performed semistructured interviews and observations across early adopter deployment sites with clinicians, strategic decision-makers, suppliers, patients with long-term chest conditions, and academics with expertise in the use of diagnostic AI in radiology settings. We coded the data using the Technology, People, Organizations, and Macroenvironmental factors framework.Results We conducted 39 interviews. Clinicians reported VLN to be easy to use with little disruption to the workflow. There were differences in patterns of use between experts and novice users with experts critically evaluating system recommendations and actively compensating for system limitations to achieve more reliable performance. Patients also viewed the tool positively. There were contextual variations in tool performance and use between different hospital sites and different use cases. Implementation challenges included integration with existing information systems, data protection, and perceived issues surrounding wider and sustained adoption, including procurement costs.Discussion Tool performance was variable, affected by integration into workflows and divisions of labor and knowledge, as well as technical configuration and infrastructure.Conclusion The socio-organizational factors affecting performance of diagnostic AI are under-researched and require attention and further research.

AB BackgroundThe number of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy studies in K-12 education has recently increased, with most research focusing on primary and secondary education contexts. Little research focuses on AI literacy programs in early childhood education.ObjectivesThe aim of this mixed-methods study is to examine the feasibility of an AI literacy program called "AI4KG" and explore how it might affect kindergarteners' perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science.MethodsA total of 26 child-parent dyads recruited from a Hong Kong kindergarten were involved in this study, consisting of 26 children (Mage = 4 years, SD = 0.28) and their parents. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys and interviews designed to explore children's perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science, and parents' perceptions of the AI4KG intervention.ResultsIt is found that children have increased their perceptions of robots after the AI literacy program, but the AI4KG curriculum had no significant effects on kindergarten children's engineering and science attitudes. Most parents (22 out of 26) agreed that their children's AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI attitudes have been enhanced after learning through the AI4KG curriculum.ConclusionsThis study suggests that the AI4KG curriculum is potentially effective in promoting early AI literacy and favourable attitudes towards the technology, but further research is needed to develop age-appropriate measures and assess its long-term impact on children's education and career paths.
   What is currently known about this topic?Implications for practice/policyAI literacy is becoming important as AI transforms society, but few studies have explored AI literacy in early childhood education.Prior research found AI activities can positively influence older children's views of robots and engineering.What does this paper add?It evaluates an 8-week AI literacy curriculum called AI4KG for kindergarteners in Hong Kong.The curriculum used tools like Teachable Machine and taught concepts through play and storytelling.It improved children's perceptions of robots but did not significantly impact engineering/science attitudes.Parents perceived improvements in children's AI knowledge, skills, and attitudes after the curriculum.The curriculum provides an example for developing age-appropriate AI literacy activities.More rigorous research on impacts over time is needed, but results suggest potential benefits of AI literacy in early childhood.Policymakers could consider incorporating AI literacy into kindergarten curricula to prepare children for the future.

AB PurposeTo describe and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various dental caries diagnostic techniques, including the use of intraoral scanners for caries diagnosis based on near-infrared imaging (NIR) technology.Material and MethodsA MEDLINE search from 1980-2023 focused on dental caries diagnostic techniques, emphasizing intraoral scanners using NIR technology. Alternative caries detection methods were also evaluated for their advantages and limitations, enabling a comparison with NIR. The review included traditional caries tools, the latest detection methods, and NIR's role in intraoral scanners, drawing from case reports and both in vivo and in vitro studies. Keywords like "caries detection," "intraoral scanners," and "Near Infrared Imaging (NIRI)" guided the search. After screening titles and abstracts for relevance, full texts with valuable insights were thoroughly analyzed. The data was grouped into three: traditional diagnostics, advanced digital methods, and intraoral scanner-based detection.ResultsThis comprehensive narrative review described and discussed the current state of dental caries diagnostic methods, given the insufficient number of clinical investigations suitable for a systematic review. Traditional caries diagnosis techniques have shown variable accuracy dependent on a dentist's experience and the potential over-removal of healthy tooth structures. Intraoral scanners have emerged as a novel caries detection method, because of their integration of NIR technology. Various studies have confirmed the efficacy of NIR in detecting interproximal caries and in the early diagnosis of non-cavitated caries. Specifically, intraoral scanners have demonstrated promising results, proving comparable to established diagnostic methods like bitewing radiography. Nevertheless, while the integration of NIR into intraoral scanners seems promising, the technology still faces challenges, notably its accuracy in detecting secondary and subgingival cavities. However, with anticipated integrations of AI, NIR in intraoral scanners could revolutionize early caries detection.ConclusionsIntraoral scanners with NIR technology offer non-destructive imaging, real-time lesion visuals, and enhanced patient communication. Although comparable to bitewing radiography in some studies, a universally accepted diagnostic tool is lacking. Future research should compare them with existing methods, focusing on clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and patient acceptance.

AB This comprehensive review paper aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the most recent developments in the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, with an emphasis on their critical role in the demand side of power distribution systems. This paper offers a meticulous examination of various AI models and a pragmatic guide to aid in selecting the suitable techniques for three areas: load forecasting, anomaly detection, and demand response in real-world applications. In the realm of load forecasting, the paper presents a thorough guide for choosing the most fitting machine learning and deep learning models, inclusive of reinforcement learning, in conjunction with the application of hybrid models and learning optimization strategies. This selection process is informed by the properties of load data and the specific scenarios that necessitate forecasting. Concerning anomaly detection, this paper provides an overview of the merits and limitations of disparate learning methods, fostering a discussion on the optimization strategies that can be harnessed to navigate the issue of imbalanced data, a prevalent concern in power system anomaly detection. As for demand response, we delve into the utilization of AI techniques, examining both incentive-based and price-based demand response schemes. We take into account various control targets, input sources, and applications that pertain to their use and effectiveness. In conclusion, this review paper is structured to offer useful insights into the selection and design of AI techniques focusing on the demand-side applications of future energy systems. It provides guidance and future directions for the development of sustainable energy systems, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for ongoing research within this swiftly evolving field.

AB IntroductionThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a diagnostic and decision-support tool is increasing in dermatology. The accuracy of image-based AI tools is incumbent on images in training sets, which requires patient consent for sharing. This study aims to understand individuals' willingness to share their images for AI and variables that influence willingness.MethodsIn an online survey administered via Amazon Mechanical Turk, sketches of the hand, face, and genitalia assigned to two use cases employing AI (research vs. personal medical care) were shown. Participants rated willingness to share the image on a 7-point Likert scale.ResultsOf the 1010 participants, individuals were most willing to share images of their hands (81.2%), face (70.3%), and lastly genitals (male: 56.8%, female: 46.7%). Individuals were more willing to share for personal care versus research (OR 0.77 [95% CI 0.69-0.86]). Willingness to share was higher among males, participants with higher education, tech-savvy participants, and frequent social media users. Most participants were willing to share images if offered monetary compensation, with face images requiring the highest payment (mean $18.25, SD 20.05). Only 38.7% of individuals refused image sharing regardless of any monetary compensation, with the majority of this group unwilling to share images of the genitals.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates overall public support for sharing images to AI-based tools in dermatology, with influencing factors including image type, context, education level, technology comfort, social media use, and monetary compensation.

AB The aim of this study is to predict the efficiency of oxidative desulfurization method (in a gas-liquid oxidation system) for gas condensate using artificial intelligence (AI) systems such as Fuzzy Inference System, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Genetic Algorithm (GA)-Fuzzy, and GA-ANFIS. The method utilizes mixtures of H2SO4, HNO3, and NO2 as oxidant agents in various amounts. The optimal parameters of the proposed models were determined using GA, and statistical parameters such as mean absolute error, average relative deviation, and correlation coefficient were used to compare the models. The correlation coefficients for Fuzzy, ANFIS, GA-Fuzzy, and GA-ANFIS models were found to be 0.5899, 0.7831, 0.9693, and 0.9687, respectively. The results indicated that ANFIS-GA and Fuzzy-GA models can effectively predict the desulfurization efficiency of the novel technique. Furthermore, the use of GA improved the performance of the Fuzzy and ANFIS models and enhanced their prediction accuracy. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of AI systems in predicting the efficiency of novel chemical methods for industrial applications.

This is particularly true in dynamic discipline like Molecular Magnetism. In order to help young researchers in this field, this article proposes a "review of reviews" also known as an "umbrella review" on lanthanide-based single-molecule magnets (4 f-SMM). As a preamble, various bibliographic search techniques and AI-based tools for bibliographic search, indexing, and summarization are proposed and commented. Then, the main milestones in 4 f-SMM are identified. In the core of the paper, books, book articles, and reviews dealing with 4 f-SMM are contextualized and classified by subtopics. This article is therefore proposed as a gateway to the 4 f-SMM field.

AB BACKGROUND Ablation index (AI) is used for guiding therapy during pulmonary vein isolation. However, its potential utility in ventricular myocardium is unknown.OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine the correlation between AI and lesion dimensions in healthy and infarcted ventricles.METHODS In ex vivo experiments using healthy swine ventricles, the correlation between AI (400-1,200) and lesion dimensions was examined at fixed power (30 W) and contact force (CF) (15 g). To examine the accuracy of AI in predicting lesion dimensions created by different combinations of ablation parameters, applications with a similar prespecified AI value created using different power (30 vs 40 W), CF (15 vs 25 g) or impedance (130-170 U) were created. In in vivo experiments, the correlation between AI and lesion dimensions was examined in healthy and infarcted myocardium.RESULTS Ex vivo experiments (247 lesions, 36 hearts) showed good correlation between AI and lesion depth (R = 0.93; P < 0.001). However, in vivo experiments (9 healthy swine and 10 infarcted swine) showed moderate correlation in healthy myocardium (R = 0.64; P < 0.01) and poor correlation in infarcted myocardium (R = 0.23; P = 0.61). AI values achieved using different combinations of power, CF, and baseline impedance resulted in different lesion depths: Ablation at 30 W produced deeper lesions compared with 40 W, ablation with CF of 15 g produced deeper lesions compared with CF of 25 g, and ablation at lower impedance produced larger lesions at similar prespecified AI values (P < 0.01 for all).CONCLUSIONS AI has limited value for guiding ablation in ventricular myocardium, particularly scar. This may be related to small proportional significance of application duration and complex tissue architecture.

AB Objectives This study evaluated if medical doctors could identify more hemorrhage events during chart review in a clinical setting when assisted by an artificial intelligence (AI) model and medical doctors' perception of using the AI model.Methods To develop the AI model, sentences from 900 electronic health records were labeled as positive or negative for hemorrhage and categorized into one of 12 anatomical locations. The AI model was evaluated on a test cohort consisting of 566 admissions. Using eye-tracking technology, we investigated medical doctors' reading workflow during manual chart review. Moreover, we performed a clinical use study where medical doctors read two admissions with and without AI assistance to evaluate performance when using and perception of using the AI model.Results The AI model had a sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 98.1% on the test cohort. In the use studies, we found that medical doctors missed more than 33% of relevant sentences when doing chart review without AI assistance. Hemorrhage events described in paragraphs were more often overlooked compared with bullet-pointed hemorrhage mentions. With AI-assisted chart review, medical doctors identified 48 and 49 percentage points more hemorrhage events than without assistance in two admissions, and they were generally positive toward using the AI model as a supporting tool.Conclusion Medical doctors identified more hemorrhage events with AI-assisted chart review and they were generally positive toward using the AI model.

AB Conventional wet laboratory testing, validations, and synthetic procedures are costly and time-consuming for drug discovery. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have revolutionized their applications to drug discovery. Combined with accessible data resources, AI techniques are changing the landscape of drug discovery. In the past decades, a series of AI-based models have been developed for various steps of drug discovery. These models have been used as complements of conventional experiments and have accelerated the drug dis-covery process. In this review, we first introduced the widely used data resources in drug discovery, such as ChEMBL and DrugBank, followed by the molecular representation schemes that convert data into computer-readable formats. Meanwhile, we summarized the algorithms used to develop AI-based models for drug discovery. Subsequently, we discussed the applications of AI techniques in pharmaceutical analysis including predicting drug toxicity, drug bioactivity, and drug physicochemical property. Furthermore, we introduced the AI-based models for de novo drug design, drug-target structure prediction, drug-target interaction, and binding affinity prediction. Moreover, we also highlighted the advanced applica-tions of AI in drug synergism/antagonism prediction and nano-medicine design. Finally, we discussed the challenges and future perspectives on the applications of AI to drug discovery.

AB While philosophers have focused on epistemological and ethical challenges of using artificial intelligence (AI) in science, scientists have focused largely on opportunities. I argue that this disconnect between philosophical pessimism and scientific optimism is driven by failures to critically examine the practice of AI-infused science. To appreciate the epistemic justification for AI-powered breakthroughs, philosophers must analyze the role of AI as part of a wider process of discovery. I demonstrate the importance of this with two cases from the scientific literature, and show that epistemic opacity need not diminish AI's capacity to lead scientists to significant and justifiable breakthroughs.

DE synthetically generated images; deepfake detection; generalization
AB New advancements for the detection of synthetic images are critical for fighting disinformation, as the capabilities of generative AI models continuously evolve and can lead to hyper-realistic synthetic imagery at unprecedented scale and speed. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of generalizing across different concept classes, e.g., when training a detector on human faces and testing on synthetic animal images - highlighting the ineffectiveness of existing approaches that randomly sample generated images to train their models. By contrast, we propose an approach based on the premise that the robustness of the detector can be enhanced by training it on realistic synthetic images that are selected based on their quality scores according to a probabilistic quality estimation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting experiments with generated images from two seminal architectures, StyleGAN2 and Latent Diffusion, and using three different concepts for each, so as to measure the cross-concept generalization ability. Our results show that our quality-based sampling method leads to higher detection performance for nearly all concepts, improving the overall effectiveness of the synthetic image detectors.

AB Data and algorithm sharing is an imperative part of data- and AI-driven economies. The efficient sharing of data and algorithms relies on the active interplay between users, data providers, and algorithm providers. Although recommender systems are known to effectively interconnect users and items in e-commerce settings, there is a lack of research on the applicability of recommender systems for data and algorithm sharing. To fill this gap, we identify six recommendation scenarios for supporting data and algorithm sharing, where four of these scenarios substantially differ from the traditional recommendation scenarios in e-commerce applications. We evaluate these recommendation scenarios using a novel dataset based on interaction data of the OpenML data and algorithm sharing platform, which we also provide for the scientific community. Specifically, we investigate three types of recommendation approaches, namely popularity-, collaboration-, and content-based recommendations. We find that collaboration-based recommendations provide the most accurate recommendations in all scenarios. Plus, the recommendation accuracy strongly depends on the specific scenario, e.g., algorithm recommendations for users are a more difficult problem than algorithm recommendations for datasets. Finally, the content-based approach generates the least popularity-biased recommendations that cover the most datasets and algorithms.

AB The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is an emerging paradigm for developing the next-generation radio access network (RAN) for 5G and beyond. Inspired by the principles from software-defined networks (SDNs), the key innovation of O-RAN is the disaggregation of control logic from the network data plane, by using a centralized RAN intelligent controller (RIC), with customized xApps and service models. The O-RAN's novel design transforms the traditional monolithic network infrastructure into an open, programmable, and interoperable RAN. These distinctive features make O-RAN ideal for deploying extensible security services against a wide range of prevalent threat vectors (e.g., malicious transmitters that spoof, interfere, or flood communications between mobile devices and the 5G RAN), which can compromise the security, privacy, and availability of mobile devices and the network itself, at very low cost. Unfortunately, we find that the existing exemplar xApp models of O-RAN and the underlying telemetry streams that drive these applications are insufficient for developing robust security countermeasures. In this paper, we propose MobiFlow, a fine-grained telemetry stream tailored for security analysis on O-RAN. We envision MobiFlow as an enabling building block upon which novel 5G services can be implemented, offering device and RAN-specific run-time security monitoring, intelligent RAN control, and security-focused AI/ML assisted applications.

AB As networks have historically been built around connectivity, architectural features concerning quality of service, mobility, security and privacy have been added as afterthoughts with consequent well known architectural headaches for their later integration. Despite Artificial Intelligence (AI) is more a means to an end, that an architectural feature itself, this is not completely different from what concerns its integration: in particular, while Cloud and Edge computing paradigms made it possible to use AI techniques to relieve part of network operation, however AI is currently little more than an additional tool. This paper describes a vision of future networks, where AI becomes a first class commodity: its founding principle lays around the concept of "fast and slow" type of AI reasoning, each of which offers different types of AI capabilities to process network data. We next outline how these building blocks naturally maps to different network segments, and discuss emerging AI-to-AI communication patterns as we move to more intelligent networks.

DE Representation Learning; Cybersecurity; NLP; Honeypots
AB Learning meaningful representations from network data is critical to ease the adoption of AI as a cornerstone to process network logs. Since a large portion of such data is textual, Natural Language Processing (NLP) appears as an obvious candidate to learn their representations. Indeed, the literature proposes impressive applications of NLP applied to textual network data. However, in the absence of labels, objectively evaluating the goodness of the learned representations is still an open problem. We call for a systematic adoption of domain-specific pretext tasks to select the best representation from network data. Relying on such tasks enables us to evaluate different representations on side machine learning problems and, ultimately, unveiling the best candidate representations for the more interesting downstream tasks for which labels are scarce or unavailable.
   We apply pretext tasks in the analysis of logs collected from SSH honeypots. Here, a cumbersome downstream task is to cluster events that exhibit a similar attack pattern. We propose the following pipeline: first, we represent the input data using a classic NLP-based approach. Then, we design pretext tasks to objectively evaluate the representation goodness and to select the best one. Finally, we use the best representation to solve the unsupervised task, which uncovers interesting behaviours and attack patterns. All in all, our proposal can be generalized to other text-based network logs beyond honeypots.

DE Intrusion Detection; Malware Identification; Threat Intelligence
AB Threat hunting and malware prediction are critical activities to ensure network and system security. These tasks are difficult due to increasing numbers of sophisticated malware families. Automatically detecting anomalous Domain Name System (DNS) queries in operational traffic facilitates the detection of new malware infections, significantly contributing to the work of security practitioners. In this paper, we present two AI-based Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) detection and classification techniques - a feature-based one, leveraging classic Machine Learning algorithms and a featureless one, based on Deep Learning - specifically intended to aid in this task. Both techniques are designed to be integrated in operational environments, dealing with hundreds of thousands to millions of new malware samples per day. We report the implementation details, the classification performance, the advantages and shortcomings for both techniques, as well as experiences from the deployment of this system in an industrial environment. We show that both techniques reach more than the 90% of accuracy in the case of binary DGA detection, with a slight degradation in performance in the multi-class classification case, in which the results strongly depend on the malware type.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has been increasingly applied in the field of chemistry in recent years. For proof of concept for the application of AI technology to polymer research, a state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technique is employed to systematically elucidate the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) copolymers using data collected from the literature. The information on 110 NIPAAm random copolymers is collected to extract their LCSTs and the chemical and physical parameters of the copolymers and comonomers. The ML analysis reveals that the copolymerized ratio, the elemental composition of carbon and oxygen in the comonomers, and the water solubility of the comonomers are crucial parameters affecting the LCST, and the constructed ML model successfully predicts the LCSTs of various NIPAAm copolymers. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm using symbolic regression identifies a simple and comprehensive descriptor for the LCST. This study demonstrates the usefulness of data-driven ML techniques for polymer research with the rapid and accurate prediction of polymer properties.

AB Purpose Not diagnosed or mistreated scapholunate ligament (SL) tears represent a frequent cause of degenerative wrist arthritis. A newly developed deep learning (DL)-based automated assessment of the SL distance on radiographs may support clinicians in initial image interpretation.Materials and Methods A pre-trained DL algorithm was specifically fine-tuned on static and dynamic dorsopalmar wrist radiography (training data set n = 201) for the automated assessment of the SL distance. Afterwards the DL algorithm was evaluated (evaluation data set n = 364 patients with n = 1604 radiographs) and correlated with results of an experienced human reader and with arthroscopic findings.Results The evaluation data set comprised arthroscopically diagnosed SL insufficiency according to Geissler's stages 0-4 (56.5%, 2.5%, 5.5%, 7.5%, 28.0%). Diagnostic accuracy of the DL algorithm on dorsopalmar radiography regarding SL integrity was close to that of the human reader (e.g. differentiation of Geissler's stages = 2 versus > 2 with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 78% compared to 77% and 80%) with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 (P < 0.01).Conclusion A DL algorithm like this might become a valuable tool supporting clinicians' initial decision making on radiography regarding SL integrity and consequential triage for further patient management.

AB Ecological regeneration will reduce air pollution, reverse forest clearing and wilderness, minimize loss of biodiversity, improve urban ecosystems, and probably enhance the livelihoods and ties between mankind and nature. Ecological regeneration risk factors include frequent changes in natural environments, imperfect interpretation of natural systems by humans, and a lack of knowledge on past successes and shortcomings. The Internet of Things (IoT) uses in environmental monitoring are varied: environmental protection, extreme weather monitoring, water safety, conservation of endangered species, and commercial farming. In this paper, artificial intelligence-based environmental decision restoration framework (AI-EDRF) has been proposed to strengthen the continuously evolving natural systems; people are deficient about natural systems and the insufficient knowledge about past achievements and failures. The biological terrestrial collective analysis is introduced to improve natural systems is rapidly evolving, and people are inadequately aware of natural systems. Stochastic water quality analysis is integrated with AI-EDRF to boost past achievements and failures. IoT-enabled smart energy management is an effective approach to provide cost-effective, efficient energy distribution and technologies are used in connection with sustainable, renewable energy sources. The computational analysis is executed based on accuracy, performance ratio, reaction time, and data deployment to verify the developed framework's reliability.

AB Purpose. - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT, a cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) language model developed by OpenAI, in successfully completing the French language version of the European Board of Ophthalmology (EBO) examination and to assess its potential role in medical education and knowledge assessment.Methods. - ChatGPT, based on the GPT-4 architecture, was exposed to a series of EBO examination questions in French, covering various aspects of ophthalmology. The AI's performance was evaluated by comparing its responses with the correct answers provided by ophthalmology experts. Additionally, the study assessed the time taken by ChatGPT to answer each question as a measure of efficiency. Results. - ChatGPT achieved a 91% success rate on the EBO examination, demonstrating a high level of competency in ophthalmology knowledge and application. The AI provided correct answers across all question categories, indicating a strong understanding of basic sciences, clinical knowledge, and clinical management. The AI model also answered the questions rapidly, taking only a fraction of the time needed by human test-takers. Conclusion. - ChatGPT's performance on the French language version of the EBO examination demonstrates its potential to be a valuable tool in medical education and knowledge assess-ment. Further research is needed to explore optimal ways to implement AI language models in medical education and to address the associated ethical and practical concerns.& COPY; 2023 L'Auteur(s).

AB Today, with rapid advances in technology, computer-based studies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are finding their place in every field, especially in the medical sector, where they attract great attention. The Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) stands as the most intricate joint within the human body, and diseases related to this joint are quite common. In this paper, we reviewed studies that utilize AI-based algorithms and computer-aided programs for investigating TMJ and TMJ-related diseases. We conducted a literature search on Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed without any time constraints and exclusively selected English articles. Moreover, we examined the references to papers directly related to the topic matter. As a consequence of the survey, a total of 66 articles within the defined scope were assessed. These selected papers were distributed across various areas, with 11 focusing on segmentation, 3 on Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), 10 on TMJ Osteoarthritis (OA), 21 on Temporomandibular Joint Disorders (TMD), 6 on decision support systems, 10 reviews, and 5 on sound studies. The observed trend indicates a growing interest in artificial intelligence algorithms, suggesting that the number of studies in this field will likely continue to expand in the future.

AB Purpose This study aims to compare artificial intelligence (AI) systems applied in diabetic retinopathy (DR) teleophthalmology screening, currently deployed systems, fairness initiatives and the challenges for implementation.Methods The review included articles retrieved from PubMed/Medline/EMBASE literature search strategy regarding telemedicine, DR and AI. The screening criteria included human articles in English, Portuguese or Spanish and related to telemedicine and AI for DR screening. The author's affiliations and the study's population income group were classified according to the World Bank Country and Lending Groups.Results The literature search yielded a total of 132 articles, and nine were included after full-text assessment. The selected articles were published between 2004 and 2020 and were grouped as telemedicine systems, algorithms, economic analysis and image quality assessment. Four telemedicine systems that perform a quality assessment, image preprocessing and pathological screening were reviewed. A data and post-deployment bias assessment are not performed in any of the algorithms, and none of the studies evaluate the social impact implementations. There is a lack of representativeness in the reviewed articles, with most authors and target populations from high-income countries and no low-income country representation.Conclusions Telemedicine and AI hold great promise for augmenting decision-making in medical care, expanding patient access and enhancing cost-effectiveness. Economic studies and social science analysis are crucial to support the implementation of AI in teleophthalmology screening programs. Promoting fairness and generalizability in automated systems combined with telemedicine screening programs is not straightforward. Improving data representativeness, reducing biases and promoting equity in deployment and post-deployment studies are all critical steps in model development.

AB Although there has been a growing interest for conversational AI (CAI) agents in the consumer electronics (CE) community, how these agents are personified by humans has been an unexplored area. Creating personality traits for CAI agents is important as it will enable providing more personalized services. Accordingly, we propose a multidimensional approach involving two distinct phases and three different experiments for generating the CAI personality by integrating concepts from human, brand, and website personality frameworks. We identify eight unique personality types, three of which are proposed for the first time. Accordingly, the research implications are discussed.

AB The advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to technological advancements in a plethora of domains. Healthcare, education, and smart city services are now enriched with AI capabilities. These technological advancements would not have been realized without the assistance of fast, secure, and fault-tolerant communication media. Traditional processing, communication, and storage technologies cannot maintain high levels of scalability and user experience for immersive services. The metaverse is an immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual world that integrates fantasy and reality into a virtual environment using advanced virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices. Such an environment is still being developed and requires extensive research in order for it to be realized to its highest attainable levels. In this article, we discuss some of the key issues required in order to attain realization of metaverse services. We propose a framework that integrates digital twin (DT) with other advanced technologies, such as the sixth-generation (6G) communication network, blockchain, and AI, to maintain continuous end-to-end metaverse services. This article also outlines requirements for an integrated, DT-enabled metaverse framework and provides a look ahead into the evolving topic.

AB While many artificial intelligence (AI) strategies are successful, countless others fail. Why do some strategies succeed while others fail? We adopt a network effects (NEs) perspective to conceptualize AI strategies, highlighting the AI context's specifics. We argue that nascent AI strategies' success depends on data NEs: companies establishing a functional "running system" to capitalize on these effects. However, this presents a challenge known as the cold-start problem (CSP), which involves initiating and accelerating a virtuous cycle: more data benefits the AI system, enhancing performance, which then attracts more data. In this paper, we examine the CSP in nascent AI strategy, exploring how it can be understood in terms of its technological and business dimensions and ultimately be overcome to kick-start a virtuous cycle of data NEs. By drawing insights from existing literature and practitioner interviews, we present a research agenda to encourage further investigation into overcoming the CSP.

LA English
DT Article
DE Breast neoplasms; Mass screening; Mammography; Artificial intelligence;
   Survey; Questionnaires
AB Purpose: To explore Norwegian breast radiologists' expectations of adding artificial intelligence (AI) in the interpretation procedure of screening mammograms.Methods: All breast radiologists involved in interpretation of screening mammograms in BreastScreen Norway during 2021 and 2022 (n = 98) were invited to take part in this anonymous cross-sectional survey about use of AI in mammographic screening. The questionnaire included background information of the respondents, their expectations, considerations of biases, and ethical and social implications of implementing AI in screen reading. Data was collected digitally and analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results: The response rate was 61% (60/98), and 67% (40/60) of the respondents were women. Sixty percent (36/60) reported & GE;10 years' experience in screen reading, while 82% (49/60) reported no or limited experience with AI in health care. Eighty-two percent of the respondents were positive to explore AI in the interpretation procedure in mammographic screening. When used as decision support, 68% (41/60) expected AI to increase the radiologists' sensitivity for cancer detection. As potential challenges, 55% (33/60) reported lack of trust in the AI system and 45% (27/60) reported discrepancy between radiologists and AI systems as possible challenges. The risk of automation bias was considered high among 47% (28/60). Reduced time spent reading mammograms was rated as a potential benefit by 70% (42/60).Conclusion: The radiologists reported positive expectations of AI in the interpretation procedure of screening mammograms. Efforts to minimize the risk of automation bias and increase trust in the AI systems are important before and during future implementation of the tool.

AB Accurate stroke assessment and consequent favorable clinical outcomes rely on the early identification and quantification of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) in non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) images. However, hemorrhagic lesions can be complex and difficult to distinguish manually. To solve these problems, here we propose a novel Hybrid 2D/3D UNet deep-learning framework for automatic aSAH identification and quantification in NCCT images. We evaluated 1824 consecutive patients admitted with aSAH to four hospitals in China between June 2018 and May 2022. Accuracy and precision, Dice scores and intersection over union (IoU), and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess model performance, segmentation performance, and correlations between automatic and manual segmentation, respectively. A total of 1355 patients with aSAH were enrolled: 931, 101, 179, and 144 in four datasets, of whom 326 were scanned with Siemens, 640 with Philips, and 389 with GE Medical Systems scanners. Our proposed deep-learning method accurately identified (accuracies 0.993-0.999) and segmented (Dice scores 0.550-0.897) hemorrhage in both the internal and external datasets, even combinations of hemorrhage subtypes. We further developed a convenient AI-assisted platform based on our algorithm to assist clinical workflows, whose performance was comparable to manual measurements by experienced neurosurgeons (ICCs 0.815-0.957) but with greater efficiency and reduced cost. While this tool has not yet been prospectively tested in clinical practice, our innovative hybrid network algorithm and platform can accurately identify and quantify aSAH, paving the way for fast and cheap NCCT interpretation and a reliable AI-based approach to expedite clinical decision-making for aSAH patients.

AB Histopathology for tumor margin assessment is time-consuming and expensive. High-resolution full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) images fresh tissues rapidly at cellular resolution and potentially facilitates evaluation. Here, we define FF-OCT features of normal and neoplastic skin lesions in fresh ex vivo tissues and assess its diagnostic accuracy for malignancies. For this, normal and neoplastic tissues were obtained from Mohs surgery, imaged using FF-OCT, and their features were described. Two expert OCT readers conducted a blinded analysis to evaluate their diagnostic accuracies, using histopathology as the ground truth. A convolutional neural network was built to distinguish and outline normal structures and tumors. Of the 113 tissues imaged, 95 (84%) had a tumor (75 basal cell carcinomas [BCCs] and 17 squamous cell carcinomas [SCCs]). The average reader diagnostic accuracy was 88.1%, with a sensitivity of 93.7%, and a specificity of 58.3%. The artificial intelligence (AI) model achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 87.6 & PLUSMN; 5.9%, sensitivity of 93.2 & PLUSMN; 2.1%, and specificity of 81.2 & PLUSMN; 9.2%. A mean intersection-over-union of 60.3 & PLUSMN; 10.1% was achieved when delineating the nodular BCC from normal structures. Limitation of the study was the small sample size for all tumors, especially SCCs. However, based on our preliminary results, we envision FF-OCT to rapidly image fresh tissues, facilitating surgical margin assessment. AI algorithms can aid in automated tumor detection, enabling widespread adoption of this technique.

AB Increasingly, students are grappling with threats to their mental wellbeing, yet teachers receive little formal education or professional development in mental health literacy and how to support students who experience mental health concerns or trauma. Given mental health disparities that exist for American Indian/Alaska Native students (AI/AN), it is of particular importance for teachers to understand how to identify and respond in a culturally sensitive way when mental health issues arise. For this reason, we conducted a survey and focus groups to examine the perspectives of teachers of AI/AN students attending a Northern Plains tribal school on student mental health. The teachers (n = 18) were almost all White and teaching in a school with exclusively AI/AN students. Findings from the survey indicated that a quarter of teachers were unsure about how to recognize students in need of mental health services and 63% were unsure about referral sources for students. Three themes emerged in the focus group data including a need for more services for students and families, uncertainty about how to support students, and a desire for improved communication among school staff about students' challenges at home. Across the themes, there was little discussion about how students' sociocultural positionalities as AI/AN youth in the United States might be contributing to challenges teachers observed, nor how social and cultural distance between students and teachers might be impacting their experiences. Implications of this work for culturally informed mental health literacy training for teachers are discussed.

AB This paper aims to explore the possibility of employing large language models (LLMs) - a type of artificial intelligence (AI) - in clinical pharmacology, with a focus on its possible misuse in bioweapon development. Additionally, ethical considerations, legislation and potential risk reduction measures are analysed. The existing literature is reviewed to investigate the potential misuse of AI and LLMs in bioweapon creation. The search includes articles from PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection that were identified using a specific protocol. To explore the regulatory landscape, the OECD.ai platform was used. The review highlights the dual-use vulnerability of AI and LLMs, with a focus on bioweapon development. Subsequently, a case study is used to illustrate the potential of AI manipulation resulting in harmful substance synthesis. Existing regulations inadequately address the ethical concerns tied to AI and LLMs. Mitigation measures are proposed, including technical solutions (explainable AI), establishing ethical guidelines through collaborative efforts, and implementing policy changes to create a comprehensive regulatory framework. The integration of AI and LLMs into clinical pharmacology presents invaluable opportunities, while also introducing significant ethical and safety considerations. Addressing the dual-use nature of AI requires robust regulations, as well as adopting a strategic approach grounded in technical solutions and ethical values following the principles of transparency, accountability and safety. Additionally, AI's potential role in developing countermeasures against novel hazardous substances is underscored. By adopting a proactive approach, the potential benefits of AI and LLMs can be fully harnessed while minimizing the associated risks.

ID STAR-TREK; FICTION
AB References to the Terminator films are central to Western imaginaries of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS). The puzzle of whether references to the Terminator franchise have featured in the United States' international regulatory discourse on these technologies nevertheless remains underexplored. Bringing the growing study of AI narratives into a greater dialogue with the International Relations literature on popular culture and world politics, this article unpacks the repository of different stories told about intelligent machines in the first two Terminator films. Through an interpretivist analysis of this material, we examine whether these AI narratives have featured in the US written contributions to the international regulatory debates on LAWS at the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in the period between 2014 and 2022. Our analysis highlights how hopeful stories about what we coin 'machine guardians' have been mirrored in these statements: LAWS development has been presented as a means of protecting humans from physical harm, enacting the commands of human decision makers and using force with superhuman levels of accuracy. This suggests that, contrary to existing interpretations, the various stories told about intelligent machines in the Terminator franchise can be mobilised to both support and oppose the possible regulation of these technologies.

AB The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed various domains, including education. Generative AI models have garnered significant attention for their potential in educational settings, but image-generative AI models need to be more utilized. This study explores the potential of integrating generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion, into art-focused STEAM classes. To this end, we combined STEAM education with image-generative AI. We designed and implemented a learning activity in which students used image-generative AI to generate creative images and wrote imaginative diaries inspired by AI-generated pictures. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected and analyzed data from surveys, interviews, and prompt datasets to gain insights into students' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors concerning the integration of generative AI in art education. Our study found that incorporating generative AI into art-focused STEAM classes may reduce the gap between male and female students' interest in art practices. We also found that the number of subjects in students' prompt datasets is linked to their divergent and convergent thinking. Finally, we discovered a meaningful correlation between the number of unique words in students' diaries and the image scores that researchers assessed. Our findings shed light on the relationship between students' divergent and convergent behaviors, offering valuable insights into their creative thinking processes. This study underscores the potential of integrating image-generative AI models in STEAM education.

AB Background Following the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsement of dual active ingredient (AI) nets, an increased uptake of pyrethroid-chlorfenapyr and pyrethroid-pyriproxyfen nets is expected. Studies evaluating their physical and insecticidal durability are essential for making programmatic and procurement decisions. This paper describes the methodology for a prospective study to evaluate the attrition, fabric integrity, insecticidal durability of Interceptor (R) G2 (alpha-cypermethrin-chlorfenapyr) and Royal Guard (R) (alpha-cypermethrin-pyriproxyfen), compared to Interceptor (R) (alpha-cypermethrin), embedded in a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in the Zou Department of Benin.Methods Ten clusters randomly selected from each arm of the cRCT will be used for the study. A total of 750 ITNs per type will be followed in 5 study clusters per arm to assess ITN attrition and fabric integrity at 6-, 12-, 24- and 36-months post distribution, using standard WHO procedures. A second cohort of 1800 nets per type will be withdrawn every 6 months from all 10 clusters per arm and assessed for chemical content and biological activity in laboratory bioassays at each time point. Alpha-cypermethrin bioefficacy in Interceptor (R) and Royal Guard (R) will be monitored in WHO cone bioassays and tunnel tests using the susceptible Anopheles gambiae Kisumu strain. The bioefficacy of the non-pyrethroid insecticides (chlorfenapyr in Interceptor (R) G2 and pyriproxyfen in Royal Guard (R)) will be monitored using the pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles coluzzii Akron strain. Chlorfenapyr activity will be assessed in tunnel tests while pyriproxyfen activity will be assessed in cone bioassays in terms of the reduction in fertility of blood-fed survivors observed by dissecting mosquito ovaries. Nets withdrawn at 12, 24 and 36 months will be tested in experimental hut trials within the cRCT study area against wild free-flying pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae sensu lato to investigate their superiority to Interceptor (R) and to compare them to ITNs washed 20 times for experimental hut evaluation studies. Mechanistic models will also be used to investigate whether entomological outcomes with each dual ITN type in experimental hut trials can predict their epidemiological performance in the cRCT.Conclusion This study will provide information on the durability of two dual AI nets (Interceptor (R) G2 and Royal Guard (R)) in Benin and will help identify suitable methods for monitoring the durability of their insecticidal activity under operational conditions. The modelling component will determine the capacity of experimental hut trials to predict the epidemiological performance of dual AI nets across their lifespan.

AB Wildfires are among the most threatening hazards to life, property, well-being, and the environment. Studying public opinions about wildfires can help monitor the perception of the impacted communities. Nevertheless, wildfire research is relatively limited compared to other climate-related hazards. This article presents our data mining work on public opinions about wildfires in Australia from 2014 to 2021. Three key aspects are analyzed: the topic of concern, sentiment polarization, and perceived emotions. We propose a data filtering approach to acquire golden samples to train a supervised model for emotion quantification to achieve the last target. The results show that the new model produces a more accurate emotion estimation than the existing lexicon approach. Through data analysis, we find that people have seen wildfires as one of the impacts of climate change; trends of tweets can reflect the damage of wildfires in real life.

AB This work presents a human memory augmentation system that uses augmented reality (AR), computer vision (CV), and artificial intelligence to replace the internal mental representation of objects in the environment with an external augmented representation. The system consists of two components: 1) an AR headset; and 2) a computing station. The AR headset runs an application that senses the indoor environment, sends data to the computing station for processing, receives the processed data, and updates the external representation of objects using a virtual 3-D object projected into the real environment in front of the user's eyes. The computing station performs CV-based indoor environment self-localization, object detection, and object-to-location binding using first-person view data received from the AR headset. We designed a behavioral study to evaluate the usability of the system. In a pilot study with 26 participants (12 females and 14 males), we investigated human performance in an experimental task that involved remembering the positions of objects in a physical space and displaying the positions of the learned objects on the 2-D map of the space. We conducted the studies under two conditions-that is, with and without using the AR system. We investigated the usability of the system, subjective workload, and performance variables under both conditions. The results showed that the AR-based augmentation of the mental representation of objects indoors reduced cognitive load and increased performance accuracy.

AB Problem definition: Restaurant review platforms, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor, routinely receive large numbers of photos in their review submissions. These photos provide significant value for users who seek to compare restaurants. In this context, the choice of cover images (i.e., representative photos of the restaurants) can greatly influence the level of user engagement on the platform. Unfortunately, selecting these images can be time consuming and often requires human intervention. At the same time, it is challenging to develop a systematic approach to assess the effectiveness of the selected images. Methodology/results: In this paper, we collaborate with a large review platform in Asia to investigate this problem. We discuss two image selection approaches, namely crowd-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems. The AI-based system we use learns complex latent image features, which are further enhanced by transfer learning to overcome the scarcity of labeled data. We collaborate with the platform to deploy our AI-based system through a randomized field experiment to carefully compare both systems. We find that the AI-based system outperforms the crowd-based counterpart and boosts user engagement by 12.43%-16.05% on average. We then conduct empirical analyses on observational data to identify the underlying mechanisms that drive the superior performance of the AI-based system. Managerial implications: Finally, we infer from our findings that the AI-based system outperforms the crowd-based system for restaurants with (i) a longer tenure on the platform, (ii) a limited number of user-generated photos, (iii) a lower star rating, and (iv) lower user engagement during the crowd-based system.

AB Deep learning-based fault diagnosis models have been demonstrated to recognise machine health conditions from vibration data. However, most related studies have focused on lateral vibration data, and mostly neglected torsional vibration data. Yet, torsional vibration data can provide an advantage in diagnosing gear faults. Torsional vibration is typically less noisy than lateral vibration data as it can be measured directly from the rotating components. To this end, this study presents a large gear fault dataset with artificial faults of varying severity acquired from a downscaled thruster test rig operated at a vast range of rotating speeds. The test rig was equipped with multiple torque transducers, rotary encoders and piezoelectric accelerometers. The lateral and torsional vibration data acquired with these sensors were evaluated with three popular convolutional neural networks in extensive ablation studies. An interpretability analysis was conducted based on amplitude spectra and Grad-CAM visualisations. The results demonstrate that torsional vibration can be an effective source of data for gear fault diagnosis. For example, the models diagnose the most difficult gear conditions using only one torque transducer more accurately than using three accelerometers mounted on the gear box. Furthermore, the highest accuracy in each ablation study related to experiments with combined lateral and torsional vibration data. In addition, the interpretability analysis showed that the lower frequencies had relatively higher amplitudes in torsional vibration than in lateral vibration. The interpretability analysis also indicates that the models reached higher classification accuracies with torsional vibration data due to the lower dominating frequencies. Overall, this study highlights the potential benefits of using torsional vibration data for deep learning-based fault diagnosis of gears.

AB Purpose: Recently, the 2022 American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA-EASD) consensus report stressed the importance of weight control in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes; weight control should be a primary target of therapy. This retrospective analysis evaluated, through an artificial-intelligence (AI) projection of data from the AMD Annals database -a huge collection of most Italian diabetology medical records covering 15 years (2005-2019) -the potential effects of the extended use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and of glucose-like peptide 1 receptor antagonists (GLP-1-RAs) on HbA(1c) and weight.Methods: Data from 4,927,548 visits in 558,097 patients were retrospectively extracted using these exclusion criteria: type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, age > 75 years, dialysis, and lack of data on HbA(1c) or weight. The analysis revealed late prescribing of SGLT-2is and GLP-1-RAs (innovative drugs), and considering a time frame of 4 years (2014-2017), a paradoxic greater percentage of combined-goal (HbA(1c) < 7% and weight gain < 2%) achievement was found with older drugs than with innovative drugs, demonstrating aspects of therapeutic inertia. Through a machine-learning AI technique, a "what-if " analysis was performed, using query models of two outcomes: (1) achievement of the combined goal at the visit subsequent to a hypothetical initial prescribing of an SGLT-2i or a GLP-1-RA, with and without insulin, selected according to the 2018 ADA-EASD diabetes recommendations; and (2) persistence of the combined goal for 18 months. The precision values of the two models were, respectively, sensitivity, 71.1 % and 69.8%, and specificity, 67% and 76%.Findings: The first query of the AI analysis showed a great improvement in achievement of the combined goal: 38.8% with prescribing in clinical practice versus 66.5% with prescribing in the "what-if " simulation. Addressing persistence at 18 months after the initial achievement of the combined goal, the simulation showed a potential better performance of SGLT-2is and GLP-1-RAs with respect to each antidiabetic pharmacologic class or combination considered.Implications: AI appears potentially useful in the analysis of a great amount of data, such as that derived from the AMD Annals. In the present study, an LLM analysis revealed a great potential improvement in achieving metabolic targets with SGLT-2i and GLP-1-RA utilization. These results underscore the importance of early, timely, and extended use of these new drugs.

AB This study intends to investigate the influence of the rainfall condition and the stability state of the soil layer on the possible time of occurring shallow landslides by building a prediction model which combines a neural network algorithm with a clustering method based on geomorphological characteristics. Therefore, the periods of shallow landslides for different local areas with various geomorphological features in a watershed can be determined. A classification method according to ground slope, soil characteristic, and drainage area is advocated to divide the watershed into multiple local regions before training the landslide prediction model. In this study, to understand the temporal and spatial variation of unstable areas, a seepage flow model and a slope stability model are jointly adopted. The physical meaning of the machine-learning-based model for predicting the duration and the start time of shallow landslides can be preserved because the model input, namely, the dynamic cumulative unstable area, is provided by conducting the theoretical seepage flow model and analyzing the soil slope stability. The proposed approach can effectively determine the periods when shallow landslides are likely to occur for different regions suggested in this study. Present results also indicate that only some specified regions, prone to induce a significant change of total unstable grids during rains, are required to be tracked and analyzed by the proposed prediction model. According to the results of analyzing the predicted errors of the shallow landslide period (Ps) and the initial time of occurring landslide (Ts), the mean relative error can be controlled within 5.19%, and the R2 can be consistently larger than 0.889 overall. Research findings also demonstrate that the predicted periods in which shallow landslides may occur can predict approximately 82.2% of the observed landslide events in the study watershed.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a focal point across a multitude of societal sectors, with science not being an exception. Particularly in the life sciences, imaging flow cytometry has increasingly integrated AI for automated management and categorization of extensive cell image data. However, the necessity of AI over traditional classification methods when extending imaging flow cytometry to include cell sorting remains uncertain, primarily due to the time constraints between image acquisition and sorting actuation. AI-enabled image-activated cell sorting (IACS) methods remain substantially limited, even as recent advancements in IACS have found success while largely relying on traditional feature gating strategies. Here we assess the necessity of AI for image classification in IACS by contrasting the performance of feature gating, classical machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the differentiation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant images. We show that classical ML could only yield a 2.8-fold enhancement in target enrichment capability, albeit at the cost of a 13.7-fold increase in processing time. Conversely, a CNN could offer an 11.0-fold improvement in enrichment capability at an 11.5-fold increase in processing time. We further executed IACS on mixed mutant populations and quantified target strain enrichment via downstream DNA sequencing to substantiate the applicability of DL for the proposed study. Our findings validate the feasibility and value of employing DL in IACS for morphology-based genetic screening of S. cerevisiae, encouraging its incorporation in future advancements of similar technologies.

AB ChatGPT has promising applications in health care, but potential ethical issues need to be addressed proactively to prevent harm. ChatGPT presents potential ethical challenges from legal, humanistic, algorithmic, and informational perspectives. Legal ethics concerns arise from the unclear allocation of responsibility when patient harm occurs and from potential breaches of patient privacy due to data collection. Clear rules and legal boundaries are needed to properly allocate liability and protect users. Humanistic ethics concerns arise from the potential disruption of the physician-patient relationship, humanistic care, and issues of integrity. Overreliance on artificial intelligence (AI) can undermine compassion and erode trust. Transparency and disclosure of AI-generated content are critical to maintaining integrity. Algorithmic ethics raise concerns about algorithmic bias, responsibility, transparency and explainability, as well as validation and evaluation. Information ethics include data bias, validity, and effectiveness. Biased training data can lead to biased output, and overreliance on ChatGPT can reduce patient adherence and encourage self-diagnosis. Ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and validity of ChatGPT-generated content requires rigorous validation and ongoing updates based on clinical practice. To navigate the evolving ethical landscape of AI, AI in health care must adhere to the strictest ethical standards. Through comprehensive ethical guidelines, health care professionals can ensure the responsible use of ChatGPT, promote accurate and reliable information exchange, protect patient privacy, and empower patients to make informed decisions about their health care.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The major objective of this research was to augment the temperature reduction characteristics of the recently developed sodium aluminate tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide montmorillonite (STEAM) warm-mix asphalt (WMA) additive by optimizing 8 dosages of 20 STEAM variants mixed with one viscosity graded-30 base asphalt binder. As the first step in the optimization process, a series of molar combinations of sodium aluminate and tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide were blended with constant concentrations of weights of montmorillonite (MMT) and water. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy test was performed on all the 20 STEAM variants to derive the hydroxyl functional groups and understand if they have potential in reducing the mixing and compaction temperatures of the STEAM-modified asphalt binder. The FTIR results indeed indicated that hydroxyl bonds increased with increasing MMT content, as a consequence of MMT releasing itself when mixed with the base asphalt binder. Next, the STEAM additives were mixed with the base binder at 8 dosages with 2 molar ratios covering 20 STEAM-modified asphalt binders on which penetration, softening point, and rotational viscosity tests were performed mainly to establish the ASTM A(i)-VTSi relationships. Depending on the combination of molar ratio and dosages, the STEAM-modified asphalt binders demonstrated a decrease of about 3 degrees C-8 degrees C of mixing and compaction temperatures. Furthermore, the STEAM additive that exhibited highest reduction in mixing temperature was blended with dense-graded aggregate gradation to produce a STEAM-modified asphalt mix, which reduced the production temperature by 10 degrees C based on the equivalent mixture performance criterion while also demonstrating stiffness performance similar to that of a control mix. Overall, the optimized indigenous STEAM WMA additives proved to be water-containing, zeolite-like products that have immense capacity in minimizing the working temperatures, albeit further studies should focus on tapping the full potentiality of several STEAM combinations to render the products as globally acceptable "green" paving materials.

AB Trash production and disposal have emerged as serious issues for underdeveloped nations as their populations have swelled. As manual classification can be both time-consuming and potentially dangerous, therefore, nowadays, it is increasingly being replaced by automated methods. Recent advances in AI and deep learning have allowed for significant advancements in trash detection and classification systems. Due to the lack of a comprehensive trash detection dataset tailored to Bangladesh, we set out to collect data that would accurately portray the complexity of Bangladesh's scenario while also incorporating openlittermap. In this study, we employ a deep learning model known as YOLOv5. Several variants of the YOLOv5 model are used and assessed with both the freshly minted dataset and the already existing benchmark datasets. Simulation results indicate that the finetuned YOLOv5 model outperforms existing models in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and F1-score. On the Bangladeshi dataset, the model shows an mAP of 34.3% and an F1-score of 43.7%. The mAP and F1-score provide a holistic evaluation of YOLOv5's object recognition accuracy, localization, and precision-recall balance. By incorporating the additional data from openlittermap into the new dataset, the mAP is increased to 45.4%. In addition, for some variants of YOLOv5, the suggested model produces greater mAP than the current literature on both the TACO and PlastOpol datasets. The model also achieves an mAP of 84.4% and an F1-score of 78.2% in single-class detection experiments with the newly created dataset. This is because concentrating on just one class helps eliminate class ambiguity, improves localization accuracy, and mitigates class imbalance.

TI Resource Allocation Based on Radio Intelligence Controller for Open RAN

AB In recent years, the open and standardized interfaces for radio access networks (Open RAN), promoted by the standard organization O-RAN alliance, demonstrate the potential to apply artificial intelligence in 6G networks. Among O-RAN, the newly introduced radio intelligence controller (RIC), including near-real-time RIC and non-real-time RIC, provides intelligent control of the radio network. However, existing research on RIC only focuses on the implementation of interfaces and progress, while ignoring the resource allocation between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC which is essential for ultra-low latency in 6G networks. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based resource allocation scheme that minimizes service latency by optimizing requests allocated and processed between near-RT RIC and non-RT RIC. Specifically, we aim at improving the request acceptance and minimum the average service latency, in our policy, we apply the Double DQN to decide whether the requests are processed at near-RT RIC or non-RT RIC and then allocate the near-RT RIC resource to finish the requests. Firstly, we define and formulate the resource allocation problem in RIC by the Markov decision process framework. Then we propose an allocation scheme based on the Double Deep Q network technique (Double DQN), with two variations (Double DQN with cache and Double DQN without cache) for handling different request types. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in offering the maximum reward. Additionally, we conduct experiments to analyze the updating of cached AI models and the results show that the performance of the proposed method is always optimal compared to other algorithms in terms of latency and accepted number of requests.

AB Seismic inversion is an approach to obtain the physical properties of the Earth layers from the seismic data, which aids in reservoir characterization. In seismic inversion, spatially variable physical parameters, such as impedance (Z), wave velocities (V-p, V-s), and density, can be determined from the seismic data. Among these, impedance is an important parameter used for lithology interpretation. However, the inversion problem is nonlinear and ill-posed due to unknown seismic wavelet, observed data band limitation, and noise. This requires complex wave equation analysis, prior assumptions, human expert effort, and time to analyze the seismic data. To address these issues, deep learning methods were deployed to solve the seismic inversion problem. In this article, we develop a deep learning framework with an attention module for seismic impedance inversion. The relevant features from the seismic data are emphasized with the integration of the attention module into the network. First, we train the attention-based deep convolutional neural network (ADCNN) by supervised learning with predefined acoustic impedance (AI) labels. Next, we train the ADCNN in an unsupervised way with the physics of the forward problem. In the proposed method, the predicted AI is used to calculate the seismic data (calculated seismic), and error is minimized between the input seismic data and calculated seismic data. Unsupervised learning has an advantage when the labeled data are inadequate. The proposed network is trained with Marmousi 2 dataset, and the predicted experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art method.

AB Freshwater shortages are a consequence of the rapid increase in population, and desalination of saltwater has gained popularity as an alternative water treatment method in recent years. To date, the forward osmosis-reverse osmosis (FO-RO) hybrid technology has been proposed as a low-energy and environmentally friendly next-generation seawater desalination process. Scaling up the FO-RO hybrid system significantly affects the success of a commercial-scale process. However, neither the ideal structure nor the membrane components for plate-and-frame FO (PFFO) and spiral-wound FO (SWFO) are known. This study aims to explore and optimize the per-formance of SWFO-RO and PFFO-RO hybrid element-scale systems in the desalination of seawater. The results showed that both hybrid systems could yield high water recovery under optimal operating conditions. The prediction of the system performance (water flux and reverse salt flux) by artificial intelligence was considerably better (R > 0.99, root mean square error <5%) than that of conventional mass balance models. A Markov-based decision tree successfully classified the water flux level in hybrid systems. An optimal set of operational con-ditions for each membrane system was proposed. For example, in RO, a combination of the feed solution (FS) flow rate (=17.5 L/min), FS concentration (<17,500 ppm), and operation pressure (<35 bar) would result in high water permeability (>40 LMH). In addition, five SWFO elements and four PFFO elements should be the optimal numbers of FO membranes in the hybrid FO-RO system for effective seawater desalination, especially for long-term operation.

ID STRAIN SENSORS
AB Next generation epidermal and wearable strain sensors are rapidly emerged as promising candidates for personalized medicine, soft machines, and human-machine interfaces. However, overshooting issues of these flexible strain sensors are major concerns during their dynamic strain monitoring, which often cause signal distortion and non-monotonic sensing characteristics. In addition, achieving a high sensitivtiy of these strain sensors within a full-body motion strain range (0-200%) remains a critical challenge. Herein, a conductive electrospun fibrous mats which are consisted of graphene anchored into fibrous thermoplastic polyurethane is proposed to endow strain sensors with anti-overshooting performance (or a good dynamic stability) and high sensitivity within full-body motion monitoring range. An overshooting-to-stable transition for the sensor's electrical performance is observed by controlling the contents of conductive agents and substrate, which is elucidated by the kinetic changing behaviors of conductive pathways along the longitudinal and transverse strain directions. By strengthening the interaction forces between fillers and matrix, the conduction pathways are capable of rapidly switching to disconnection in response to external strains, thus achieving an ultrahigh sensitivity. The developed skin sensing platform is capable of detecting full range physiological signals and achieving healthcare Internet of Things in achilles tendon rehabilitation. Furthermore, a wearable Morse code-tospeech translation system powered with deep learning algorithm was demonstrated, with high recognition accuracy (>98.5%) and fast response time (similar to 16 ms).

We measure the AI applications of Chinese listed firms based on text analytics on annual reports from 2007 to 2020. Our results show that AI applications increase stock liquidity, and the effect of AI on increasing stock liquidity is more significant in SOEs and high-tech firms. In addition, AI increases stock liquidity by enhancing market attention rather than directly improving firm performance.

AB In an international context where social effects and ethics related to artificial intelligence (AI) are receiving more attention, there is a dearth of research about how AI specialists perceive the future of work and their role in bringing about the respective future. Does the fact that ethics and social issues are receiving more publicity impact AI specialists' views? The current study advances knowledge about this issue by describing a deep qualitative investigation of the visions of AI developers and researchers in Hungary, a country on the semi-periphery concerning the development of these technologies. In recent years, social and ethical challenges linked to AI have been covered in the Hungarian media as well, although they are less of a hot topic than in some Western countries. The twenty AI specialist interviewees' accounts were characterised by their perception of the current period as one of hype, expectations of a slow and limited amount of technological change, techno-optimism, as well as a distancing of responsibility. Notably, the change in the media climate does not appear to have affected their thinking: social consequences and ethical issues associated with technology were neglected in their accounts. Potential drivers of their views and the potential effects of the country context are discussed, as well as the consequences of the experts' expectations and implications for AI research and development.

AB This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive investigation to demonstrate early pregnancy detection using thermography in heifers and cows. A total of 60 heifers (n: 30) and cows (n: 30) were divided into two groups as pregnant (n: 15 heifers, n: 15 cows) and non-pregnant (n: 15 heifers, n: 15 cows) according to the day 28 of gestation. Thermographic images were taken from the vulvar and anal regions on alternate days from D0 to D20. Blood samples were collected to determine estrogen and progesterone concentrations. The mean temperature difference between the anal and vulvar regions (?T C-?) was used in the statistical analyses. Based on the hormonal profiles, no abnormalities were observed for follicular waves or luteal profiles in heifers and cows. The ?T C-? values between heifers and cows and between days were statistically significant (P < 0.001). In thermographic analyses, the differences observed in other main effects and interactions of the group, sampling time, and pregnancy were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, it was concluded that the ?T C-? value of = 2.9 C-? (100% Se -61.9% Sp) was highly correlated with pregnancy diagnosis in cows on day six after artificial insemination (AI) (P < 0.001). In conclusion, it was determined that the clinical application of thermography can be used for the detection of pregnancy on day six after AI in cows. However, further studies are needed to determine heifers' thermographic characteristics and profiles.

AB As the demand for data-intensive analytics has increased with the rapid advance in artificial intelligence (AI), various AI accelerators have been proposed. However, as AI-based solutions have been adapted to applications requiring accuracy and reliability, the reliability of them has become a critical issue. For this reason, self-test and self-recovery for AI accelerator (STRAIT) is proposed in this article. It facilitates self-test, self-diagnosis, and self-recovery by utilizing the structural and operational characteristics of systolic array in AI accelerator. The proposed self-test is progressed using scan chains composed of functional paths and can achieve a 100% test coverage (for both stuck-at and transition-delay faults) with a small number of test patterns and reduced test power. The proposed self-diagnosis is progressed with the proposed self-test in real time and allows accurate fault localization with fault type analysis. The proposed self-recovery is progressed using efficient pruning for faulty processing elements with weight allocation, and the reliability of AI accelerators can drastically increase with negligible performance degradation. However, STRAIT can be implemented with a small area overhead.

Advances in DL and AI have enabled better and faster-than-ever extraction of information from ultrasound data. POCUS is becoming increasingly popular due to its cost-effectiveness, improved image quality, and ease of use. In addition, manufacturers have moved away from analog beamforming to digital beamforming, which provides researchers with access to raw data which is usually more information-rich than beamformed B-mode images. Concurrently, medical robotics is becoming ever more established in its traditional application and is further finding new, emerging clinical applications. The Guest Editors are delighted to present 14 papers in this Spotlight Issue on Interventional Ultrasound.

AB Recently, many AI-aided layout design systems are developed to reduce tedious manual intervention based on deep learning. However, most methods focus on a specific generation task. This paper explores a challenging problem to obtain multiple layout design generation (LDG), which generates floor plan or urban plan from a boundary input under a unified framework. One of the main challenges of multiple LDG is to obtain reasonable topological structures of layout generation with irregular boundaries and layout elements for different types of design. This paper formulates the multiple LDG task as an image-to-image translation problem, and proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), called LDGAN, with adaptive modules. The framework of LDGAN is based on a generator-discriminator architecture, where the generator is integrated with conditional convolution constrained by the boundary input and the attention module with channel and spatial features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments were conducted on the SCUT-AutoALP and RPLAN datasets, and the comparison with the state-of-the-art methods illustrate the effec-tiveness and superiority of the proposed LDGAN.

AB Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO, EC 1.3.3.4) is the last common enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway in the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll. The high-frequency use of PPO inhibitor herbicides has led to the gradual exposure of pesticide damage and resistance problems. In order to solve this kind of problem, there is an urgent need to develop new PPO inhibitor herbicides. In this paper, 16 phenylpyrazole derivatives were designed by the principle of active substructure splicing through the electron isosterism of five-membered heterocycles. Greenhouse herbicidal activity experiments and in vitro PPO activity experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of compound 9 on weed growth was comparable to that of pyraflufen-ethyl. Crop safety experiments and cumulative concentration experiments in crops showed that when the spraying concentration was 300 g ai/ha, wheat, corn, rice and other cereal crops were more tolerant to compound 9, among which wheat showed high tolerance, which was comparable to the crop safety of pyraflufen-ethyl. Herbicidal spectrum experiments showed that compound 9 had inhibitory activity against most weeds. Molecular docking results showed that compound 9 formed one hydrogen bond interaction with amino acid residue ARG-98 and two 7C-7C stacking interactions with amino acid residue PHE-392, indicating that compound 9 had better herbicidal activity than pyraflufen-ethyl. It shows that compound 9 is expected to be a lead compound of phenylpyrazole PPO inhibitor herbicide and used as a herbicide in wheat field.

AB In North Dakota (ND), American Indian women are more likely to be exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and interpersonal violence, and receive late prenatal care (PNC) compared to other racial groups. In a sample of 1,849 (weighted n = 26,348) women from the 2017 to 2019 North Dakota Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, we performed a series of logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for AI and Other Racial Identity women compared to White women regarding risk of late PNC (initiated after week 13) and dissatisfaction of PNC timing. Models were adjusted for interpersonal violence (from husband/partner, family member, someone outside of family, ex-husband/partner, or any) to determine if violence accounts for racial/ethnic disparities in PNC. AI women experienced two-fold higher risk of late PNC (OR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.55, 3.26) and dissatisfaction of PNC timing (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.61, 3.40) than White women. In the analyses for the association between joint ACEs (Higher: = 4; Lower: <4)/Race and PNC outcomes, odds of late PNC were two-fold among AI women with Higher ACEs (OR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.94) and Lower ACEs (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.69, 4.41), compared to White women with Lower ACEs. Results were similar for dissatisfaction of PNC timing. Accounting for violence did not significantly change odds ratios in any analyses. Thus, interpersonal violence surrounding pregnancy does not explain racial disparities in PNC in ND. To understand disparities in PNC among AI women, risk factors like historic trauma and systemic oppression should be examined.

AB The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of supplementing 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcidiol, CAL) compared with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, CHOL) at 1 or 3 mg/d in late gestation on production outcomes of dairy cows. One hundred thirtythree parous and 44 nulliparous pregnant Holstein cows were enrolled in the experiment. Cows were blocked by parity and previous lactation milk yield (parous) or genetic merit (nulliparous) and assigned randomly to receive 1 or 3 mg/d of CAL or CHOL in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments (CAL1, CAL3, CHOL1, and CHOL3). Treatments were provided to individual cows as a top-dress to the prepartum diet from 250 d in gestation until parturition. The prepartum diet had a dietary cation-anion difference of -128 mEq/kg of dry matter. Production and disease were evaluated for the first 42 d in milk, and reproduction was evaluated to 300 d in milk. Incidence of postpartum diseases did not differ among treatments. Feeding CAL compared with CHOL increased yields of colostrum and colostrum fat, protein, and total solids, resulting in an increased amount of net energy for lactation secreted as colostrum (CHOL = 7.0 vs. CAL = 9.0 & PLUSMN; 0.7 Mcal). An interaction between source and amount was observed for milk yield: CAL3 increased milk yield compared with CHOL3 (CHOL3 = 34.1 vs. CAL3 = 38.7 & PLUSMN; 1.4 kg/d) but milk yield did not differ between CAL1 and CHOL1 (CHOL1 = 36.9 vs. CAL1 = 36.4 & PLUSMN; 1.4 kg/d). Concentrations of serum calcidiol on day of calving and average serum Ca from d 2 to 11 postpartum were positively associated with milk yield in the first 42 d in milk. Interactions between source and amount of vitamin D were also observed for pregnancy after first AI: the percentage of cows receiving CHOL1 and CAL3 that became pregnant was smaller than that of cows receiving CHOL3 and CAL1. However, pregnancy per AI and pregnancy by 300 d in milk did not differ among treatments. Overall, CAL3 increased milk yield compared with CHOL3, whereas in cows fed 1 mg/d (CAL1 and CHOL1), the source of vitamin D generally had no effect. The effect of CAL3 may be explained in part by serum CAL concentrations and postpartum serum Ca, which were associated with milk yield.

AB Reward tampering is a problem that will impact the trustworthiness of the powerful AI systems of the future. Reward Tampering describes the problem where AI agents bypass their intended objective, enabling unintended and potentially harmful behaviours. This paper investigates whether the creative potential of evolutionary algorithms could help ensure trustworthy solutions when facing this problem. The reason why evolutionary algorithms may help combat reward tampering is that they are able to find a diverse collection of different solutions to a problem within a single run, aiding the search for desirable solutions. Four different evolutionary algorithms were deployed in tasks illustrating the problem of reward tampering. The algorithms were designed with varying degrees of human expertise, measuring how human guidance influences the ability to discover trustworthy solutions. The results indicate that the algorithms' ability to find and preserve trustworthy solutions is very dependent on preserving diversity during the search. Algorithms searching for behavioural diversity showed to be the most effective against reward tampering. Human expertise also showed to improve the certainty and quality of safe solutions, but even with only a minimal degree of human expertise, domain-independent diversity management was found to discover safe solutions.

DE Transfer learning; Collaborative recommendation; Bias reduction;
   Unbiased data
AB In a recommender system, a user's interaction is often biased by the items' displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user's self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data alone. In this paper, we introduce an additional specially collected unbiased data, and then have a new problem called collaborative recommendation with biased and unbiased data. We first formalize the studied problem and list three challenges, including the bias challenge, the heterogeneity challenge and the unbalance challenge. Then we propose a novel transfer learning-based AI solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we use two different models to extract the users' preferences and bias information, and then refine the prediction via the latent features containing the bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased recommendation. We further integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. Moreover, in order to better address the unbalance challenge, we introduce a bias regularization term and integrate bidirectional knowledge distillation. Finally, we adopt four representative methods, i.e., variational autoencoders, matrix factorization, neural collaborative filtering and graph convolution network, as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on three public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The anogenital distance (AGD) is considered a marker for prenatal androgen exposure and fertility in multiple species including humans. In dairy cattle, it is described as the length between the center of the anus and the clitoral base (AGDc). However, in other species, the distance from the center of the anus to the dorsal commissure of the vulva (AGDv) is also considered to be a predictor for fertility traits, as well as the anogenital ratio (AGR, defined as [AGDv/AGDc]*100). The primary aim of the present study was to assess whether AGDv and AGR can be used as an indicator for reproductive performance in dairy heifers. Additionally, the relation between AGDv and AGDc and the correlation with other body measurements were explored. Data of 656 Holstein Friesian heifers at an age of 13.5 +/- 1.08 months were analyzed. Respective means of 62.9 +/- 8.20 mm (AGDv) and 107.6 +/- 9.27 mm (AGDc) were recorded. The mean AGR ratio was calculated as 58.6 +/- 6.75%, varying from 37.3 to 79.6%. The age of the heifers was not associated with any of the AGD measurements nor the ratio. Except for a very low correlation between heart girth and AGDc (r = 0.09, P < 0.05), both AGDs were largely uncorrelated with other body measurements. Linear regression models revealed that AGDc was not associated with any of the recorded fertility parameters. However, results revealed a negative association between AGDv and AGR and reproductive performance: heifers with a short AGDv and small AGR were younger at first AI (P = 0.003) and at conception (P = 0.004). Based on ROC curve analyses, AGDv was the best indicator for pregnancy to first AI, with a threshold estimated at 65.3 mm. The pregnancy rate at first AI was 72.4% in heifers with a short AGDv (<65.3 mm, n = 413) compared to 61.7% in heifers with a long AGDv (>= 65.3 mm, n = 243). Hence, short-AGDv heifers had 63% higher odds to conceive at first AI compared to their long-AGDv counterparts (P = 0.004). Additionally, an AGR threshold of 59,6% was determined: heifers with a small AGR (<59.6%) had 44% higher odds to be pregnant at first AI compared to heifers with an AGR >= 59.6%. Results of the present study suggest to consider AGDv and AGR as potential indicators for reproductive performance in dairy heifers. The latter implies that it is relevant to measure both AGDc and AGDv in future studies. The absence of correlation between body- and AGD-measurements furthermore suggests that AGD sizes are rather pre-than postnatally determined.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning framework for additive manufacturing (AM), that can detect different defect types without being trained on specific defect data sets and can be applied for real-time process control.Design/methodology/approachThis study develops an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, a zero-bias deep neural network (DNN) model for real-time defect detection during the AM process. In this method, the last dense layer of the DNN is replaced by two consecutive parts, a regular dense layer denoted (L1) for dimensional reduction, and a similarity matching layer (L2) for equal weight and non-biased cosine similarity matching. Grayscale images of 3D printed samples acquired during printing were used as the input to the zero-bias DNN.FindingsThis study demonstrates that the approach is capable of successfully detecting multiple types of defects such as cracks, stringing and warping with high accuracy without any prior training on defective data sets, with an accuracy of 99.5%.Practical implicationsOnce the model is set up, the computational time for anomaly detection is lower than the speed of image acquisition indicating the potential for real-time process control. It can also be used to minimize manual processing in AI-enabled AM.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to use zero-bias DNN, an explainable AI approach for defect detection in AM.

AB The ESTHER database, dedicated to ESTerases and alpha/beta-Hydrolase Enzymes and Relatives (https://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/ESTHER/general?what=index), offers online access to a continuously updated, sequence-based classification of proteins harboring the alpha/beta hydrolase fold into families and subfamilies. In particular, the database proposes links to the sequences, structures, ligands and huge diversity of functions of these proteins, and to the related literature and other databases. Taking advantage of the promiscuity of enzymatic function, many engineered esterases, lipases, epoxide-hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenases are used for biotechnological applications. Finding means for detoxifying those protein members that are targeted by insecticides, herbicides, antibiotics, or for reactivating human cholinesterases when inhibited by nerve gas, are still active areas of research. Using or improving the capacity of some enzymes to breakdown plastics with the aim to recycle valuable material and reduce waste is an emerging challenge. Most hydrolases in the superfamily are water-soluble and act on or are inhibited by small organic compounds, yet in a few subfamilies some members interact with other, unrelated proteins to modulate activity or trigger functional partnerships. Recent development in 3D structure prediction brought by AI-based programs now permits analysis of enzymatic mechanisms for a variety of hydrolases with no experimental 3D structure available. Finally, mutations in as many as 34 of the 120 human genes compiled in the database are now linked to genetic diseases, a feature fueling research on early detection, metabolic pathways, pharmacological treatment or enzyme replacement therapy. Here we review those developments in the database that took place over the latest decade and discuss potential new applications and recent and future expected research in the field.

AB Several advanced imaging techniques are now available for endoscopists managing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. These tools, including dye-based and virtual chromoendoscopy, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy and endocytoscopy, are increasingly innovative applications in clinical practice. They allow for a more in-depth and refined evaluation of the mucosal and vascular bowel surface, getting closer to histology. They have demonstrated a remarkable ability in assessing intestinal inflammation, histologic remission, and predicting relapse and favorable long-term outcomes. In addition, the future application of molecular endoscopy to predict biological drug responses has yielded preliminary but encouraging results. Furthermore, these techniques are crucial in detecting and characterizing IBD-related dysplasia, assisting endoscopic mucosal resection and submucosal dissection towards a surgery-sparing approach. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great potential in this promising landscape, as it can provide an objective and reproducible assessment of inflammation and dysplasia. Moreover, it can improve the prediction of outcomes and aid in subsequent therapeutic decision-making. This review aims to summarize the promising role of state-of-the-art advanced endoscopic techniques and related AI-enabled models for managing IBD, paving the way for precision medicine.

AB This comprehensive study reviews the latest and most popular artificial intelligence (AI) techniques utilised for estimating pan evaporation (Ep), an essential parameter for water resource management and irrigation planning. Through an extensive evaluation of 76 papers published between 2006 and 2022, this study analyses the input data categories, time steps, properties, and capabilities of different AI models used for estimating Ep across various regions. The reviewed papers offer partial and comprehensive observations, providing valuable insights for researchers looking to model Ep in similar studies. Furthermore, this study proposes innovative theories and approaches to enhance the efficacy of Ep modelling in the relevant analysis domain. While hybrid AI techniques have gained popularity due to their perceived superiority over standalone deep learning and machine learning approaches, they often pose significant operational and computational challenges for Ep forecasting. As such, the study strongly recommends the use of transformer neural networks for Ep estimation, given their unique architecture and promising performance across various fields. Overall, this study presents a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the latest AI-based techniques for estimating Ep and highlights the most promising approaches for future research.

AB Purpose of ReviewArtificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have emerged as a potential tool to transform urology by improving patient care and physician efficiency. With an emphasis on their potential advantages and drawbacks, this literature review offers a thorough assessment of the state of AI-driven chatbots in urology today.Recent FindingsThe capacity of AI-driven chatbots in urology to give patients individualized and timely medical advice is one of its key advantages. Chatbots can help patients prioritize their symptoms and give advice on the best course of treatment. By automating administrative duties and offering clinical decision support, chatbots can also help healthcare providers. Before chatbots are widely used in urology, there are a few issues that need to be resolved. The precision of chatbot diagnoses and recommendations might be impacted by technical constraints like system errors and flaws. Additionally, issues regarding the security and privacy of patient data must be resolved, and chatbots must adhere to all applicable laws. Important issues that must be addressed include accuracy and dependability because any mistakes or inaccuracies could seriously harm patients. The final obstacle is resistance from patients and healthcare professionals who are hesitant to use new technology or who value in-person encounters.SummaryAI-driven chatbots have the potential to significantly improve urology care and efficiency. However, it is essential to thoroughly test and ensure the accuracy of chatbots, address privacy and security concerns, and design user-friendly chatbots that can integrate into existing workflows. By exploring various scenarios and examining the current literature, this review provides an analysis of the prospects and limitations of implementing chatbots in urology.

AB BackgroundConventional glucocorticoids (C-GC) replacement regimens have a detrimental effect on skeletal health in patients with adrenal insufficiency (AI), ultimately leading to an increased fracture risk. The novel dual-release hydrocortisone (DR-HC) formulations are characterized by a more favourable safety profile on various clinical endpoints. Data comparing the impact of C-GC and DR-HC on bone, however, are scarce.MethodsTwenty-seven patients with autoimmune primary AI (PAI; 13 treated with C-GC and 14 treated with DR-HC) were evaluated to compare bone-related parameters between the two treatment groups.ResultsNo significant differences between the two treatments groups were observed with respect to bone turnover markers. Patients treated with C-GC showed a lower bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (LS; 0.791 & PLUSMN; 0.195 vs. 0.942 & PLUSMN; 0.124 g/cm2, p=0.025) and at femoral neck (FN; 0.633 & PLUSMN; 0.114 vs. 0.716 & PLUSMN; 0.088 g/cm2, p=0.045). Moreover, they were characterized by a lower trabecular bone score (TBS; 1.236 & PLUSMN; 0.035 vs. 1.383 & PLUSMN; 0.030, p=0.004) and by a higher mean number of vertebral fractures per patient (0.75 vs. 0 fractures, p=0.002). TBS was the best predictor of fracture risk, with a pseudo-R2 of 0.593; moreover, at mediation analysis, it was able to fully explain the observed detrimental effect of C-GC, compared to DR-HC, on fracture risk.ConclusionsThese results suggest that DR-HC is associated with less bone-related complications compared to C-GC in patients with PAI. Moreover, TBS seems to play a pivotal role in the mediation of the relationship between glucocorticoid treatment regimens and fracture risk.

AB The widespread adoption of mobile technologies offers an opportunity for a new approach to post-discharge care for patients with heart failure (HF). By enabling non-invasive remote monitoring and two-way, real-time communication between the clinic and home-based patients, as well as a host of other capabilities, mobile technologies have a potential to significantly improve remote patient care. This literature review summarizes clinical evidence related to virtual healthcare (VHC), defined as a care team + connected devices + a digital solution in post-release care of patients with HF. Searches were conducted on Embase (06/12/2020). A total of 171 studies were included for data extraction and evidence synthesis: 96 studies related to VHC efficacy, and 75 studies related to AI in HF. In addition, 15 publications were included from the search on studies scaling up VHC solutions in HF within the real-world setting. The most successful VHC interventions, as measured by the number of reported significant results, were those targeting reduction in rehospitalization rates. In terms of relative success rate, the two most effective interventions targeted patient self-care and all-cause hospital visits in their primary endpoint. Among the three categories of VHC identified in this review (telemonitoring, remote patient management, and patient self-empowerment) the integrated approach in remote patient management solutions performs the best in decreasing HF patients' re-admission rates and overall hospital visits. Given the increased amount of data generated by VHC technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) is being investigated as a tool to aid decision making in the context of primary diagnostics, identifying disease phenotypes, and predicting treatment outcomes. Currently, most AI algorithms are developed using data gathered in clinic and only a few studies deploy AI in the context of VHC. Most successes have been reported in predicting HF outcomes. Since the field of VHC in HF is relatively new and still in flux, this is not a typical systematic review capturing all published studies within this domain. Although the standard methodology for this type of reviews was followed, the nature of this review is qualitative. The main objective was to summarize the most promising results and identify potential research directions.

AB The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging analysis has significantly impacted musculoskeletal radiology, offering enhanced accuracy and speed in radiograph evaluations. The potential of AI in clinical settings, however, remains underexplored. This research investigates the efficiency of a commercial AI tool in analyzing radiographs of patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty. The study retrospectively analyzed 200 radiographs from 100 patients, comparing AI software measurements to expert assessments. Assessed parameters included axial alignments (MAD, AMA), femoral and tibial angles (mLPFA, mLDFA, mMPTA, mLDTA), and other key measurements including JLCA, HKA, and Mikulicz line. The tool demonstrated good to excellent agreement with expert metrics (ICC = 0.78-1.00), analyzed radiographs twice as fast (p < 0.001), yet struggled with accuracy for the JLCA (ICC = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.72-0.84), the Mikulicz line (ICC = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.32-0.90), and if patients had a body mass index higher than 30 kg/m(2) (p < 0.001). It also failed to analyze 45 (22.5%) radiographs, potentially due to image overlay or unique patient characteristics. These findings underscore the AI software's potential in musculoskeletal radiology but also highlight the necessity for further development for effective utilization in diverse clinical scenarios. Subsequent studies should explore the integration of AI tools in routine clinical practice and their impact on patient care.

AB Purpose: Surgical guide plates can improve the accuracy of surgery, although their design process is complex and time-consuming. This study aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to design standardized mandibular angle ostectomy guide plates and reduce clinician workload.
   Methods: An intelligence algorithm was designed and trained to design guide plates, with a safety-ensuring penalty factor added. A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted to test the algorithm among patients who had visited our hospital between 2020 and 2021 for mandibular angle ostectomy. We included patients diagnosed with mandibular angle hypertrophy and excluded those combined with other facial malformations. The guide plate design method acted as the primary predictor, which was AI algorithm vs. experienced residents. Moreover, the symmetry of plate-guided ostectomy was chosen as the primary outcome. The safety, shape, location, effectiveness, and design duration of the guide plate were also recorded. The independent samples t-test and Pearson's chi-squared test were used and P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
   Results: Fifty patients (7 men, 43 women; 27 +/- 4 years) were included. The two groups differed significantly in terms of safety (7.02 vs. 5.25, P < 0.05) and design duration (24.98 vs. 1685.08, P < 0.05). The ostectomy symmetry and shape, location, and effectiveness of the guide plates did not differ significantly between the two groups.
   Conclusions: The intelligent algorithm can improve safety and save time for guide plate design, ensuring other quality of the guide plates. It has good potential applicability in accurate mandibular angle ostectomy. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

AB Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) treatment planning requires accurate delineation of brain metastases, a task that can be tedious and time-consuming. Although studies have explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for automatic brain metastases delineation, none of these studies have performed clinical evaluation, raising concerns about clinical applicability. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) tool for the automatic delineation of single brain metastasis that could be integrated into clinical practice.Methods: Data from 426 patients with postcontrast T1-weighted MRIs who underwent SRS between March 2007 and August 2019 were retrospectively collected and divided into training, validation, and testing cohorts of 299, 42, and 85 patients, respectively. Two Gamma Knife (GK) surgeons contoured the brain metastases as the ground truth. A novel 2.5D CNN network was developed for single brain metastasis delineation. The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average surface distance (ASD) were used to assess the performance of this method.Results: The mean DSC and ASD values were 88.34%& PLUSMN;5.00% and 0.35 & PLUSMN;0.21 mm, respectively, for the contours generated with the AI tool based on the testing set. The DSC measure of the AI tool's performance was dependent on metastatic shape, reinforcement shape, and the existence of peritumoral edema (all P values <0.05). The clinical experts' subjective assessments showed that 415 out of 572 slices (72.6%) in the testing cohort were acceptable for clinical usage without revision. The average time spent editing an AI-generated contour compared with time spent with manual contouring was 74 vs. 196 seconds, respectively (P<0.01).Conclusions: The contours delineated with the AI tool for single brain metastasis were in close agreement with the ground truth. The developed AI tool can effectively reduce contouring time and aid in GK treatment planning of single brain metastasis in clinical practice.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this study is to construct a synthetic dataset of ECG signal that overcomes the sensitivity of personal information and the complexity of disclosure policies.
   Methods: The public dataset was constructed by generating synthetic data based on the deep learning model using a convolution neural network (CNN) and bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), and the effectiveness of the dataset was verified by developing classification models for ECG diagnoses.
   Results: The synthetic 12-lead ECG dataset generated consists of a total of 6000 ECGs, with normal and 5 abnormal groups. The synthetic ECG signal has a waveform pattern similar to the original ECG signal, the average RMSE between the two signals is 0.042 mu V, and the average cosine similarity is 0.993. In addition, five classification models were developed to verify the effect of the synthetic dataset and showed performance similar to that of the model made with the actual dataset. In particular, even when the real dataset was applied as a test set to the classification model trained with the synthetic dataset, the classification performance of all models showed high accuracy (average accuracy 93.41%).
   Conclusion: The synthetic 12-lead ECG dataset was confirmed to perform similarly to the real-world 12-lead ECG in the classification model. This implies that a synthetic dataset can perform similarly to a real dataset in clinical research using AI. The synthetic dataset generation process in this study provides a way to overcome the medical data disclosure challenges constrained by privacy rights, a way to encourage open data policies, and contribute significantly to promoting cardiovascular disease research.

AB The skin microbiome is thought to play a critical role in maintaining skin health and protecting against infection. While most microorganisms that live on the skin are harmless or even beneficial, some can cause skin infections or other health problems, emphasizing the importance of diagnosis of the composition and diversity of the skin flora. However, conventional diagnostic methods for evaluation of the skin microbiome are not sensitive enough to detect bacteria at low concentrations and suffer from poor specificity, thus limiting early diagnosis of bacterial infections. In this study, we developed novel approaches for bacterial species detection and identification methods with single-cell sensitivity using super-resolution microscopy and AI-based image analysis: a protein quantification-based method and an AI-based bacterial image analysis method. We demonstrate that these methods can differentiate between common bacterial members of the skin flora, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and different ribotypes of Cutibacterium acnes, both in purified bacterial samples and in scaling skin samples. The advantages of these methods, including the lack of time-consuming amplification or purification steps and single-cell level detection sensitivity, allow early diagnosis of bacterial infections, even from bacterial samples at extremely low concentrations, thus showing promise as a next-generation platform for microbiome detection as single-cell diagnostics.

AB There is a growing urgency to discover better materials that capture CO2 from air and improve battery performance. An important step is to search large databases of materials properties to find examples that resemble known carbon capture agents or electrolytes and then test them for effectiveness. This paper describes novel computational tools for accelerated discovery of solvents, nano-porous materials, and electrolytes. These tools have produced interesting results so far, such as the identification of a relatively isolated location in amine configuration space for the solvents with known carbon capture use, and the demonstration of an end-to-end simulation and process model for carbon capture in MOFs.

AB BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF) may occur asymptomatically and can be diagnosed only with electrocardiography (ECG) while the arrhythmia is present.OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to independently validate the approach of using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify underlying paroxysmal AF from a 12-lead ECG in sinus rhythm (SR).METHODS An AI algorithm was trained to identify patients with underlying paroxysmal AF, using electrocardiographic data from all in-and outpatients from a single center with at least 1 ECG in SR. For patients without AF, all ECGs in SR were included. For patients with AF, all ECGs in SR starting 31 days before the first AF event were included. The patients were randomly allocated to training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7:1:2 ratio. In a secondary analysis, the AF prevalence of the testing group was modified. Additionally, the performance of the algorithm was validated at an external hospital.RESULTS The dataset consisted of 494,042 ECGs in SR from 142,310 patients. Testing the model on the first ECG of each patient (AF prevalence 9.0%) resulted in accuracy of 78.1% (95% CI: 77.6%-78.5%), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.86-0.87), and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.46-0.50). In a low-risk group (AF prevalence 3%), the AUPRC decreased to 0.21 (95% CI: 0.18-0.24). In a high-risk group (AF prevalence 30%), the AUPRC increased to 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78). This performance was robust when validated in an external hospital.CONCLUSIONS The approach of using an AI-enabled electrocardiographic algorithm for the identification of patients with underlying paroxysmal AF from ECGs in SR was independently validated.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are powerful tools shaping the healthcare sector. This review considers twelve key aspects of AI in clinical practice: 1) Ethical AI; 2) Explainable AI; 3) Health Equity and Bias in AI; 4) Sponsorship Bias; 5) Data Privacy; 6) Genomics and Privacy; 7) Insufficient Sample Size and Self-Serving Bias; 8) Bridging the Gap Between Training Datasets and Real-World Scenarios; 9) Open Source and Collaborative Development; 10) Dataset Bias and Synthetic Data; 11) Measurement Bias; 12) Reproducibility in AI Research. These categories represent both the challenges and opportunities of AI implementation in healthcare. While AI holds significant potential for improving patient care, it also presents risks and challenges, such as ensuring privacy, combating bias, and maintaining transparency and ethics. The review underscores the necessity of developing comprehensive best practices for healthcare organizations and fostering a diverse dialogue involving data scientists, clinicians, patient advocates, ethicists, economists, and policymakers. We are at the precipice of significant transformation in healthcare powered by AI. By continuing to reassess and refine our approach, we can ensure that AI is implemented responsibly and ethically, maximizing its benefit to patient care and public health.

TI Model-based reinforcement learning with non-Gaussian environment

DT Article
AB The rapid development of quantitative portfolio optimization in financial engineering has produced promising results in AI-based algorithmic trading strategies. However, the complexity of financial markets poses challenges for comprehensive simulation due to various factors, such as abrupt transitions, unpredictable hidden causal factors, and heavy tail properties. This paper aims to address these challenges by employing heavy-tailed preserving normalizing flows to simulate the high-dimensional joint probability of the complex trading environment under a model-based reinforcement learning framework. Through experiments with various stocks from three financial markets (Dow, NASDAQ, and S & P), we demonstrate that Dow outperforms the other two based on multiple evaluation metrics in our testing system. Notably, our proposed method mitigates the impact of unpredictable financial market crises during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a lower maximum drawdown. Additionally, we explore the explanation of our reinforcement learning algorithm, employing the pattern causality method to study interactive relationships among stocks, analyzing dynamics of training for loss functions to ensure convergence, visualizing high-dimensional state transition data with t-SNE to uncover effective patterns for portfolio optimization, and utilizing eigenvalue analysis to study convergence properties of the environment's model.

AB Background: The use of artificial insemination (AI) in dairy cattle has a direct impact on productivity through genetic improvement and, indirectly, by other technologies that allow for better expression of the genetic potential. Objective: To determine the association between the use of AI and other factors on productive performance of dairy cows. Methods: The study assessed AI impact on 195 dairy farms through the application of structured questionnaires to farmers. Analysis of variance (GLM) was used to evaluate herd milk production and farm size. Multivariate analysis was performed to observe the degree of association between AI and production. Four clusters were formed according to production traits and farm size. Results: Clusters showed high discrimination (90%). Principal factors explained 70% of the variance between clusters. The variables that best explained the variation between clusters were Lactating cows per year, Monthly milk production, Farm area and Total cows. The correspondence analyzes showed that AI use is associated with higher production levels and investment in nutrition, management, genetics, and technology. Conclusion: The use of AI enhances production by increasing productivity and enables greater gains per liter of milk marketed.

AB MotivationUtilizing AI-driven approaches for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction require large volumes of training data which are not available for the majority of target proteins. In this study, we investigate the use of deep transfer learning for the prediction of interactions between drug candidate compounds and understudied target proteins with scarce training data. The idea here is to first train a deep neural network classifier with a generalized source training dataset of large size and then to reuse this pre-trained neural network as an initial configuration for re-training/fine-tuning purposes with a small-sized specialized target training dataset. To explore this idea, we selected six protein families that have critical importance in biomedicine: kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, nuclear receptors, proteases, and transporters. In two independent experiments, the protein families of transporters and nuclear receptors were individually set as the target datasets, while the remaining five families were used as the source datasets. Several size-based target family training datasets were formed in a controlled manner to assess the benefit provided by the transfer learning approach.ResultsHere, we present a systematic evaluation of our approach by pre-training a feed-forward neural network with source training datasets and applying different modes of transfer learning from the pre-trained source network to a target dataset. The performance of deep transfer learning is evaluated and compared with that of training the same deep neural network from scratch. We found that when the training dataset contains fewer than 100 compounds, transfer learning outperforms the conventional strategy of training the system from scratch, suggesting that transfer learning is advantageous for predicting binders to under-studied targets.

AB The mobility sector is experiencing a global transition towards cleaner and more sustainable technologies. Many mobility projects are developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to improve the operational efficiency of mobility, such as charging system optimization for electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving, and traffic controls. This study presents such projects' global distribution by showing a geographic information system (GIS)-generated map and analyzes the readiness level of those technologies by employing the Japanese Technology Readiness Assessment (J-TRA) methodology. The results show that most projects are located in Europe. Among the analyzed AI uses, the smart parking system and lane tracing assistance technologies have the highest level of readiness. Further training of AI to be fully compatible with the real operating environments and updates of traffic policies are necessary to allow advancement of the technology readiness of the rest of AI mobility technologies types.

AB With increasing connectivity to support digital services in urban areas, there is a realization that demand for offering similar capability in rural communities is still limited. To unlock the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) within rural economies, we propose rural AI-the mobilization of serverless computing to enable AI in austere environments. Inspired by problems observed in New Zealand, we analyze major challenges in agrarian communities and define their requirements. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept rural AI system for cross-field pasture weed detection that illustrates the capabilities serverless computing offers to traditional federated learning.

AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising privacy-preserving solution to build powerful AI models. In many FL scenarios, such as healthcare or smart city monitoring, the user's devices may lack the required capabilities to collect suitable data, which limits their contributions to the global model. We contribute social-aware federated learning as a solution to boost the contributions of individuals by allowing outsourcing tasks to social connections. We identify key challenges and opportunities, and establish a research roadmap for the path forward. Through a user study with N = 30 participants, we study collaborative incentives for FL showing that social-aware collaborations can significantly boost the number of contributions to a global model provided that the right incentive structures are in place.

AB Survival analysis is a subfield of statistics concerned with modeling the occurrence time of a particular event of interest for a population. Survival analysis found widespread applications in healthcare, engineering, and social sciences. However, real-world applications involve survival datasets that are distributed, incomplete, censored, and confidential. In this context, federated learning can tremendously improve the performance of survival analysis applications. Federated learning provides a set of privacy-preserving techniques to jointly train machine learning models on multiple datasets without compromising user privacy, leading to a better generalization performance. However, despite the widespread development of federated learning in recent AI research, few studies focus on federated survival analysis. In this work, we present a novel federated algorithm for survival analysis based on one of the most successful survival models, the random survival forest. We call the proposed method Federated Survival Forest (FedSurF). With a single communication round, FedSurF obtains a discriminative power comparable to deep-learning-based federated models trained over hundreds of federated iterations. Moreover, FedSurF retains all the advantages of random forests, namely low computational cost and natural handling of missing values and incomplete datasets. These advantages are especially desirable in real-world federated environments with multiple small datasets stored on devices with low computational capabilities. Numerical experiments compare FedSurF with state-of-the-art survival models in federated networks, showing how FedSurF outperforms deep-learning-based federated algorithms in realistic environments with non-identically distributed data.

ID CONFIDENCE
AB Measuring robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) is an important topic for trustworthy AI. Existing methods for verifying local robustness of DNNs usually face the scalability problem and have difficulties to deal with nonlinear activation functions and complex semantic perturbations. Existing methods for measuring global robustness usually rely on large datasets, so it is difficult for users without a large dataset to compare the global robustness of different networks. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to measure the local and global robustness of DNNs from the lens of statistical model checking. Compared with the local robustness estimation method using the Okamoto bound, our method can provide the same theoretical guarantee using only 48.6%-74.1% of running time. Our global robustness estimation algorithm can provide highquality estimation using only 10 images for CIFAR-10 and 50 images for ImageNet, thus can be used in a wider range of scenarios.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Energy and data-efficient online time series prediction for predicting evolving dynamical systems are critical in several fields, especially edge AI applications that need to update continuously based on streaming data. However, current Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based supervised online learning models require a large amount of training data and cannot quickly adapt when the underlying system changes. Moreover, these models require continuous retraining with incoming data making them highly inefficient. We present a novel Continuous Learning-based Unsupervised Recurrent Spiking Neural Network Model (CLURSNN), trained with spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to solve these issues. CLURSNN makes online predictions by reconstructing the underlying dynamical system using Random Delay Embedding by measuring the membrane potential of neurons in the recurrent layer of the recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) with the highest betweenness centrality. We also use topological data analysis to propose a novel methodology using the Wasserstein Distance between the persistent homologies of the predicted and observed time series as a loss function. We show that the proposed online time series prediction methodology outperforms state-of-the-art DNN models when predicting an evolving Lorenz63 dynamical system.

DE Text classification; Deep Learning; L2 Writing; Data Fusion; ChatGPT
AB Essay classification is a crucially important task, considering the increasing attention towards AI tools such as ChatGPT, and the raised concerns with regard to academic integrity. Existing text classification approaches, including neural network-based methods and feature-based methods, are often unable to effectively analyze diverse types of information in a combined way. Moreover, they are mostly tailored for English data, and focus on addressing specific topics, such as fake news, hate speech, and misinformation. On the other hand, machine learning research conducted on essay data has been limited to automated grading and off-topic detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based model that combines text modeling and linguistic features via data fusion, with the aim to provide robust classification capabilities. Our experiments with datasets containing short essays in English and Spanish written by L2 learners, show that it is possible to accurately perform essay classification, and that our model is competitive, even when compared to popular feature-based and neural network-based approaches.

AB State-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems have demonstrated promising performance in solving visual relationship-based reasoning problems. However, they struggle in solving complex problems where the answers require sophisticated logical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid symbolic-neural reasoning model that integrates deep neural network vision and language features with a symbolic reasoner connected to a knowledge base. The symbolic reasoner effectively combines visual and linguistic information with ontological relationships and common-sense reasoning to address complex logical questions. We replace the multimodal fusion layer in traditional VQA deep neural networks with an innovative logical reasoning component, generating reasoned answers and clear logical inference chains. Moreover, we propose developing a notion of Question Difficulty, reflecting the logical complexity of VQA questions and their difficulty level in terms of being answered. Current VQA approaches excel at straightforward logic but struggle with increased question difficulty. Our hybrid method performs better as it has access to an additional logical reasoner through the knowledge base to produce answers that require logical inference.

AB The traditional telemarketing call centers are being hunched by significant human resources costs related to high workers' workload, as well as even higher turnover-rate, which are also proven to be impossible to be solved by Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot alone. In view of this dilemma, applying AI techniques to assist human salespeople in call centers by instantly analyzing the phone call between salesperson and customer, thus recommending a response for the salesperson, becomes a challenging yet applicable means. In this paper, we propose a multi-turn dialogue agent based on Deep Attention Matching Network (DAM) with SimBERT, used as a data augmentation tool to efficiently improve the response selection accuracy. Experiments on a real-world telemarketing scenario dataset have confirmed its validity.

ID ALGORITHM
AB With growing concerns about the unwanted bias or discrimination in machine learning, a number of fairness-aware machine learning algorithms have been developed to mitigate bias in the prediction. Because the objectives of accuracy and fairness are antagonistic, it is hard to balance the trade-off between them. Recently, Multi-objective Evolutionary Learning (MOEL) framework has been proposed to train a set of Pareto models with the consideration of accuracy and fairness simultaneously. However, this framework prefers to train more accurate models rather than fairer models due to the lack of gradient in terms of fairness. In this paper, MOEL is enhanced through introducing Adversarial Learning (AL). The MOEL-AL framework aims to maximize a set of predictors' ability to predict true labels and minimize the ability of an adversarial network to predict the sensitive attributes from the predictors' output. Specifically, the adversarial network can be regarded as a proxy of the undifferentiable fairness metrics, so it is possible to propagate gradients in terms of both accuracy and fairness for the predictors during the back-propagation process. Besides, the adversarial strength for different predictors is adjusted dynamically according to their fairness metric. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental studies on seven well-known datasets show that our method can provide a set of fairer Pareto models with little drop on accuracy.

AB Applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms in creative works challenges the justifications and effectiveness of Copyright Protection aimed at human authors. AI-assisted musical works influence the value of rights held by stakeholders in the music industry associated with human artists' earnings, the production of new original works, and public access to protected compositions. The lenient approach that allows computer-generated works to invoke copyright protection questions how the law perceives what constitutes 'original' works. The philosophical research question of this paper asks, 'how do AI-assisted works affect our understanding of musical creation and their copyright protection.' The work incorporates a doctrinal approach to expose how AI tools compromise the presumptions behind the originality criteria of creative freedom, independent creation, and human authors' labor, skill, and judgment. Following the creative process adopted in compositions and exposing elements that attract copyright protection, the discourse reveals how AI imposes a quantifiable nature upon melodies. The findings show that the limited spectrum for musical creation and the expedited and low-cost process of AI-assisted compositions undermine justifications behind copyright protection. The paper seeks to expose and bridge the gap between AI tools application and their socio-legal impact on the music industry.

DE Clustering; Multiagent systems; Artificial intelligence in games;
   Hebbian learning; Unsupervised learning
AB Large multi-agent systems such as real-time strategy games are often driven by collective behavior of agents. For example, in StarCraft II, human players group spatially near agents into a team and control the team to defeat opponents. In this light, clustering the agents in the game has been used for various purposes such as the efficient control of the agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning and game analytic tools for the game users. However, despite the useful information provided by clustering, learning the dynamics of multi-agent systems at a cluster level has been rarely studied yet. In this paper, we present a hybrid AI model that couples unsupervised and self-supervised learning to forecast evolution of the clusters in StarCraft II. We develop an unsupervised Hebbian learning method in a set-to-cluster module to efficiently create a variable number of the clusters with lower inference time complexity than K-means clustering. Also, a long short-term memory based prediction module is designed to recursively forecast state vectors generated by the set-to-cluster module to define cluster configuration. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed model successfully predicts complex movement of the clusters in the game.

AB Automated hand gesture recognition has been a focus of the AI community for decades. Traditionally, work in this domain revolved largely around scenarios assuming the availability of the flow of images of the operator's/user's hands. This has partly been due to the prevalence of camera-based devices and the wide availability of image data. However, there is growing demand for gesture recognition technology that can be implemented on low-power devices using limited sensor data instead of high-dimensional inputs like hand images.
   In this work, we demonstrate a hand gesture recognition system and method that uses signals from capacitive sensors embedded into the etee hand controller. The controller generates real-time signals from each of the wearer's five fingers. We use a machine learning technique to analyse the time-series signals and identify three features that can represent 5 fingers within 500 ms. The analysis is composed of a two-stage training strategy, including dimension reduction through principal component analysis and classification with K-nearest neighbour. Remarkably, we found that this combination showed a level of performance which was comparable to more advanced methods such as supervised variational autoencoder. The base system can also be equipped with the capability to learn from occasional errors by providing it with an additional adaptive error correction mechanism. The results showed that the error corrector improve the classification performance in the base system without compromising its performance. The system requires no more than 1 ms of computing time per input sample, and is smaller than deep neural networks, demonstrating the feasibility of agile gesture recognition systems based on this technology.

AB Stress-strain curves are important representations of a given material's mechanical properties, which depend primarily on the orientation of the individual crystals in the microstructure. Generating stress-strain curves from numerical methods such as the crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations is computationally intensive. As a result, it is difficult to generate complete stress-strain curves for all possible orientations of a material. In this work, we propose a bilinear stress-strain curve prediction framework for metallic alloys by integrating supervised and unsupervised deep learning methods via transfer learning principles. As a specific case-study, we focus on predicting stress-strain curves of Nickel (Ni)-based superalloys that have important applications in aerospace industry. Using a small training set of just 100 complete stress-strain curves (4,000 strain steps each) of different orientations generated by CPFE simulation code, we were able to build a model that could accurately predict stress-strain curves (<2 % error) using simple features that could be obtained by running the CPFE simulation for just a single strain step. The proposed model can thus predict the complete stress-strain curve for a given orientation of Ni-based superalloys in a fraction of a second, which amounts to a speedup of over 4000x as compared to the simulation.

AB Transformers' compute-intensive operations pose enormous challenges for their deployment in resource-constrained EdgeAI / tinyML devices. As an established neural network compression technique, quantization reduces the hardware computational and memory resources. In particular, fixed-point quantization is desirable to ease the computations using lightweight blocks, like adders and multipliers, of the underlying hardware. However, deploying fully-quantized Transformers on existing general-purpose hardware, generic AI accelerators, or specialized architectures for Transformers with floating-point units might be infeasible and/or inefficient. Towards this, we propose SwiftTron, an efficient specialized hardware accelerator designed for Quantized Transformers. SwiftTron supports the execution of different types of Transformers' operations (like Attention, Softmax, GELU, and Layer Normalization) and accounts for diverse scaling factors to perform correct computations. We synthesize the complete SwiftTron architecture in a 65 nm CMOS technology with the ASIC design flow. Our Accelerator executes the RoBERTa-base model in 1.83 ns, while consuming 33.64 mW power, and occupying an area of 273 mm(2). To ease the reproducibility, the RTL of our SwiftTron architecture is released at https: //github.com/albertomarchisio/SwiftTron.

AB Recent progress in the fields of AI and cognitive sciences opens up new challenges and problems that were previously inaccessible to study. One of such modern tasks is recovering lost data of one modality by using the data from another one. A similar effect (called the McGurk Effect) has been found in the functioning of the human brain. Observing this effect, one modality of information interferes with another, changing its perception. In this paper, we propose a way to reproduce such an effect and use it to reconstruct lost data modalities by combining Variational Auto-Encoders, Self-Organizing Maps, and Hebb connections in a unified ReD-SOM (Reentering Deep Self-organizing Map) model. We are inspired by human's capability to use different zones of the brain in different modalities, in case of having a lack of information in one of the modalities. This new approach not only improves the analysis of ambiguous data but also restores the intended signal. The results obtained on the multimodal dataset show an increase of quality of the signal reconstruction. The effect is remarkable both visually and quantitatively, specifically in presence of a significant degree of signal's distortion.

AB With the expansion of AI-powered virtual assistants, there is a need for low-power keyword spotting systems providing a "wake-up" mechanism for subsequent computationally expensive speech recognition. One promising approach is the use of neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented in neuromorphic processors for sparse event-driven sensing. However, this requires resource-efficient SNN mechanisms for temporal encoding, which need to consider that these systems process information in a streaming manner, with physical time being an intrinsic property of their operation. In this work, two candidate neurocomputational elements for temporal encoding and feature extraction in SNNs described in recent literature-the spiking time-difference encoder (TDE) and disynaptic excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) elements-are comparatively investigated in a keyword-spotting task on formants computed from spoken digits in the TIDIGITS dataset. While both encoders improve performance over direct classification of the formant features in the training data, enabling a complete binary classification with a logistic regression model, they show no clear improvements on the test set. Resource-efficient keyword spotting applications may benefit from the use of these encoders, but further work on methods for learning the time constants and weights is required to investigate their full potential.

ID SECURITY
AB Many sets of ethics principles for responsible AI have been proposed to allay concerns about misuse and abuse of AI/ML systems. The underlying aspects of such sets of principles include privacy, accuracy, fairness, robustness, explainability, and transparency. However, there are potential tensions between these aspects that pose difficulties for AI/ML developers seeking to follow these principles. For example, increasing the accuracy of an AI/ML system may reduce its explainability. As part of the ongoing effort to operationalise the principles into practice, in this work we compile and discuss a catalogue of 10 notable tensions, trade-offs and other interactions between the underlying aspects. We primarily focus on two-sided interactions, drawing on support spread across a diverse literature. This catalogue can be helpful in raising awareness of the possible interactions between aspects of ethics principles, as well as facilitating well-supported judgements by the designers and developers of AI/ML systems.

AB Visual AI systems are vulnerable to natural and synthetic physical corruption in the real-world. Such corruption often arises unexpectedly and alters the model's performance. In recent years, the primary focus has been on adversarial attacks. However, natural corruptions (e.g., snow, fog, dust) are an omnipresent threat to visual AI systems and should be considered equally important. Many existing works propose interesting solutions to train robust models against natural corruption. These works either leverage image augmentations, which come with the additional cost of model training, or place suspicious patches in the scene to design unadversarial examples. In this work, we propose the idea of naturalistic support artifacts (NSA) for robust prediction. The NSAs are shown to be beneficial in scenarios where model parameters are inaccessible and adding artifacts in the scene is feasible. The NSAs are natural looking objects generated through artifact training using DC-GAN to have high visual fidelity in the scene. We test against natural corruptions on the Imagenette dataset and observe the improvement in prediction confidence score by four times. We also demonstrate NSA's capability to increase adversarial accuracy by 8% on average. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze NSAs using saliency maps to understand how they help improve prediction confidence.

AB Informed machine learning describes the injection of prior knowledge into learning systems. It can help to improve generalization, especially when training data is scarce. However, the field is so application-driven that general analyses about the effect of knowledge injection are rare. This makes it difficult to transfer existing approaches to new applications, or to estimate potential improvements. Therefore, in this paper, we present a framework for quantifying the value of prior knowledge in informed machine learning. Our main contributions are threefold. Firstly, we propose a set of relevant metrics for quantifying the benefits of knowledge injection, comprising in-distribution accuracy, out-of-distribution robustness, and knowledge conformity. We also introduce a metric that combines performance improvement and data reduction. Secondly, we present a theoretical framework that represents prior knowledge in a function space and relates it to data representations and a trained model. This suggests that the distances between knowledge and data influence potential model improvements. Thirdly, we perform a systematic experimental study with controllable toy problems. All in all, this helps to find general answers to the question how knowledge injection helps in informed machine learning.

AB Music accompaniment generation is a crucial aspect in the composition process. Deep neural networks have made significant strides in this field, but it remains a challenge for AI to effectively incorporate human emotions to create beautiful accompaniments. Existing models struggle to effectively characterize human emotions within neural network models while composing music. To address this issue, we propose the use of an easy-to-represent emotion flow model, the Valence/Arousal Curve, which allows for the compatibility of emotional information within the model through data transformation and enhances interpretability of emotional factors by utilizing a Variational Autoencoder as the model structure. Further, we used relative self-attention to maintain the structure of the music at music phrase level and to generate a richer accompaniment when combined with the rules of music theory. Our experimental results indicate that the emotional flow of the music generated by our model has a strong correlation with the input emotion, demonstrating the model's strong interpretability and control of emotional flow. The generated music is also well-structured, diverse, and dynamic, outperforming the baseline models.

DE API call sequence; neural network; Encoder-Decoder; AI; code generation
AB API, namely application programming interface, can help developers implement their functions conveniently. To implement a function like dialing in Android, developers sometimes need to call many APIs organised in a special pattern, called API call sequence. However, existing methods rarely focus on code generation for API call sequence.
   In this paper, we introduce neural network into the application field of generating API call sequence code for Android. The purpose is realising Android code automatically generation by inputting function description. To reach this goal, we first design an API call sequence code graph which is named ACSCG to well represent the Android function code structure and then we convert the ACSCG to API call sequence. Besides, we devise an AI model based on Encoder-Decoder neural network to study the corresponding relation feature of function description and API call sequence. When finishing training the model, one can give a function description to it and generate corresponding API call sequence. After all above has been done, an algorithm is implemented to successfully convert the API call sequence into target code. To verify the efficiency of our method, we collect high quality code from Github and Gitee to build a dataset including 1000 items associated with essential functions in Android such as taking photo, file management, android browser and so on. The experiment shows that our model has a better performance in generating API call sequence code than state-of-the-art technologies.

DE machine learning; high-dimensional low-samplesize (HDLS);
   quasi-orthogonality
AB For learning algorithms, accessing large volumes of annotated data is highly desirable but not always available, especially in real-world scenarios. Accordingly, learning in the highdimensional and low-sample size (HDLS) domain is recognised as one of the core challenges for modern AI systems. In this work, we consider a particular but very practical scenario in the HDLS domain where the number of training samples is not limited to mere few observations but yet it is not large enough to reliably build models with high degrees of expressivity.
   To address the problem, we present a new neuromorphic algorithm capable of fine-tuning existing feature spaces via learning relevant associations in high dimensional data with high probability. The algorithm is based on the idea of Concept Cells [1] and mimics properties attributed to memory and learning inherent to live neural systems. We demonstrate, through numerous numerical experiments, that the algorithm can "finetune" and "adapt" the feature space of pre-trained neural networks for better performance on new tasks in the HDLS domain. In addition, we study the impact of this "tuning" on quasi-orthogonal measures, which correlates with classification and calibration metrics.

DE Explainable AI; XAI; Named Entity Recognition
AB In the last decades, deep learning approaches achieved impressive results in many research fields, such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP in particular has greatly benefit from unsupervised methods that allow to learn distributed representation of language. On the race for better performances Language Models have reached hundred of billions parameters nowadays. Despite the remarkable results, deep models are still far from being fully exploited in real world applications. Indeed, these approaches are black-boxes, i.e. they are not interpretable by design nor explainable, which is often crucial to make decisions in business. Several task-agnostic methods have been proposed in literature to explain models' decisions. Most techniques rely on the "local" assumption, i.e. explanations are made example-wise. In this paper instead, we present a post-hoc method to produce highly interpretable global rules to explain NLP classifiers. Rules are extracted with a data mining approach on a semantically enriched input representation, instead of using words/wordpieces solely. Semantic information yields more abstract and general rules that are both more explanatory and less complex, while being also better at reflecting the model behaviour. In the experiments we focus on Named Entity Recognition, an NLP task where explainability is under-investigated. We explain the predictions of BERT NER classifiers trained on two popular benchmarks, CoNLL03 and Ontonotes, and compare our model against LIME [1] and Decision Trees.

AB The research described in this paper concerns the automation of back-office workflows for the capacity management of hospitality services: continuously monitoring clients' reservations and hotel registrations and automatically updating the decisions that establish optimal staffing levels to assure dependable and accurate services with minimum personnel cost, and maintaining a minimal stable workforce level. The service capacity management workflows connect multiple instances of online reservation and front-office customer registration processes (booking, check-in taxation, check-out invoicing according to the back-office strategy) with a combination of marketing- and operations-oriented back-office processes that: a) best match capacity and demand for quality services, and b) optimize the staffing levels and personnel workshift schedules. These workflows with many operations and complex timing are automated with the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology that uses AI techniques for seasonality prediction of confirmed service demand. A case study of optimal hotel staff assignment with RPA using the Blue Prism scheduler is included, and the gains of using RPA solutions are presented.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent significant advancements in computing, building on technologies that humanity has developed over millions of years-from the abacus to quantum computers. These tools have reached a pivotal moment in their development. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received over 100 product registration submissions that heavily relied on AI/ML for applications such as monitoring and improving human performance in compiling dossiers. To ensure the safe and effective use of AI/ML in drug discovery and manufacturing, the FDA and numerous other U.S. federal agencies have issued continuously updated, stringent guidelines. Intriguingly, these guidelines are often generated or updated with the aid of AI/ML tools themselves. The overarching goal is to expedite drug discovery, enhance the safety profiles of existing drugs, introduce novel treatment modalities, and improve manufacturing compliance and robustness. Recent FDA publications offer an encouraging outlook on the potential of these tools, emphasizing the need for their careful deployment. This has expanded market opportunities for retraining personnel handling these technologies and enabled innovative applications in emerging therapies such as gene editing, CRISPR-Cas9, CAR-T cells, mRNA-based treatments, and personalized medicine. In summary, the maturation of AI/ML technologies is a testament to human ingenuity. Far from being autonomous entities, these are tools created by and for humans designed to solve complex problems now and in the future. This paper aims to present the status of these technologies, along with examples of their present and future applications.

AB Intelligent diagnosis processes rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide possible diagnoses by analyzing patient data and medical information. To make accurate and quick diagnoses, it is possible to use AI tools to efficiently analyze huge amounts of data and find patterns that a clinician might miss. In recent years, new large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google BARD, have shown remarkable capabilities in several domains, including intelligent diagnostics. This research aims to compare the performances of ChatGPT and traditional machine learning models for making diagnoses of low- and medium- risk diseases only based on their symptoms. On the basis of our study, we defined four research questions: RQ1) What are the benefits and limitations of using ChatGPT in intelligent diagnosis? RQ2) How do traditional machine learning approaches compare to ChatGPT for intelligent diagnosis? RQ3) How does ChatGPT compare with other LLMs and domain-specific natural language processing models in the intelligent diagnosis tasks?, and RQ4) What are the implications of the predictive models and ChatGPT for healthcare, and how can they be used to support people?. To answer these RQs, we first evaluate the performances of different engines of ChatGPT, also introducing a new prompt engineering methodology specifically tailored for achieving accurate diagnostic outcomes. Moreover, we compare these results with those achieved by different predictive models trained for intelligent diagnosis tasks, i.e., Google BARD, and two domain-specific NLP models. Finally, we propose a new interactive bot available for users that relies on the best-performing models evaluated in the previous steps. The experiments have been conducted using two medical datasets for disease prediction consisting of more than 100 symptoms associated with several diagnoses.

AB Neuroscientists apply a range of analysis tools to recorded neural activity in order to glean insights into how neural circuits drive behavior in organisms. Despite the fact that these tools shape the progress of the field as a whole, we have little empirical proof that they are effective at identifying the mechanisms of interest. At the same time, deep learning systems are trained to produce intelligent behavior using neural networks, and the resulting models are impressive but also largely impenetrable. Can the tools of neuroscience be applied to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and if so what would this process tell us about ANNs, brains, and - most importantly - the tools themselves? Here we argue that applying analysis methods from neuroscience to ANNs will provide a much-needed test of the abilities of these tools. It would also encourage the development of a unified field of neural systems understanding, which can identify shared concepts and methods for studying distributed information processing in artificial and biological systems. To support this argument, we review methods commonly used in neuroscience, along with work that has demonstrated how these methods can be applied to ANNs and what we learn from this, and related efforts from interpretable AI.

AB In this study, two strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lacticaseibacillus paracasei GL1 and Lactobacillus helveticus SNA12) and one yeast strain of Kluyveromyces marxianus G-Y4 (G-Y4) isolated from Tibetan kefir grains were co cultured. It was found that the addition of G-Y4 could not only promote the growth of lactic acid bacteria, but also increase the release of metabolites (lactic acid, ethanol, and amino nitrogen). Furthermore, the addition of live cells and cell-free fermentation supernatant (CFS) of G-Y4 could increase the ability of biofilm formation. Morever, the surface characteristics results showed that the addition of G-Y4 live cells could enhance the aggregation ability and hydrophobicity of LAB. Meanwhile, adding live cells and CFS of G-Y4 could promote the release of signaling molecule AI-2 and enhance the expression of the LuxS gene related to biofilm formation. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and chemical composition analysis were used to investigate the composition of the biofilm, and the results indicated that the biofilm was mainly composed of a small amount of protein but it was rich in polysaccharides including glucose, galactose, and mannose with different ratios. Finally, the formation of biofilm could delay the decline of the number of viable bacteria in storage fermented milk.

AB Anomaly detection in the execution of business processes in the organizations has a high level of complexity due to the consideration of various process perspectives and their constraints, business rules, privacy policies, and regulations. Furthermore, only detection of anomalies is not sufficient. There is a crucial need for the results of anomaly detection to be explainable and interpretable, enabling users to adapt the decision making process and handle the detected anomalies. The work presented in this paper aims to provide business process owners with human-interpretable explanations for patterns of deviations found between process models and event data recorded during the execution of business processes, while traditional conformance checking methods only report low-level deviations found.First, by introducing an automated approach for multi-perspective conformance checking and anomaly detection in business process executions, we extract expected and unexpected behavior from event logs and identify patterns in deviations. Finally, by focusing on identifying the context involved in patterns of unexpected behavior, our approach facilitates the interpretations of detected patterns. The approach has been implemented in the open source ProM framework and its applicability is evaluated through a real-life dataset from a financial organization. The experiment not only shows that we can automatically detect more complex anomalies such as spurious data processing and misusage of authorizations, but also that we can explain these deviations in context.

AB This study presents the Co-oriented Scansis (CoS) model, which provides a comprehensive understanding of scansis-a recently identified crisis type integrated into the Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT). Using a crisis case of Scatter Lab, a South Korean AI company, as a model case, the study applies the CoS model to analyze the perceptions and meta-perceptions of both the organization and the public regarding the crisis. The data collection involved three official statements released by Scatter Lab and an analysis of 365 reviews from the Google Play users' reviews page of Science of Love-the app used by Scatter Lab to collect intimate conversations between romantic partners. The findings highlight the utility of the CoS model in explaining how Scatter Lab's AI crisis evolved into a scansis. Specifically, the organization's failure to accurately comprehend the public's perception of the crisis (second level co-orientation) and the resulting discrepancy between the organization and the public's perceptions (third level co-orientation) contributed to moral outrage, ultimately leading to a scansis. The study concludes by discussing the theoretical contributions of the CoS model and its practical implications for crisis management.

AB Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent heart valve disease in western countries that poses a significant public health challenge due to the lack of a medical treatment to prevent valve calcification. Given the aging population demographic, the prevalence of AS is projected to rise, resulting in a progressively significant healthcare and economic burden. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the gold standard approach, the less invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is poised to become the dominant method for high-and medium-risk interventions. Computational simulations using patient-specific models, have opened new research avenues for optimizing emerging devices and predicting clinical outcomes. The traditional techniques of generating digital replicas of patients' aortic root, native valve, and calcification are time-consuming and laborintensive processes requiring specialized tools and expertise in anatomy. Alternatively, deep learning models, such as the U-Net architecture, have emerged as reliable and fully automated methods for medical image segmentation. Two-dimensional U-Nets have been shown to produce comparable or more accurate results than trained clinicians' manual segmentation while significantly reducing computational costs. In this study, we have developed a fully automatic AI tool capable of reconstructing the digital twin geometry and analyzing the calcification distribution on the aortic valve. The developed automatic segmentation package enables the modeling of patient-specific anatomies, which can then be used to simulate virtual interventional procedures, optimize emerging prosthetic devices, and predict clinical outcomes.

   Oral Cancer
AB Objectives: Given the increasing incidence of oral cancer, it is essential to provide high-risk communities, especially in remote regions, with an affordable, user-friendly tool for visual lesion diagnosis. This proof-of-concept study explored the utility and feasibility of a smartphone application that can photograph and diagnose oral lesions. Methods: The images of oral lesions with confirmed diagnoses were sourced from oral and maxillofacial textbooks. In total, 342 images were extracted, encompassing lesions from various regions of the oral cavity such as the gingiva, palate, and labial mucosa. The lesions were segregated into three categories: Class 1 represented non-neoplastic lesions, Class 2 included benign neoplasms, and Class 3 contained premalignant/malignant lesions. The images were analysed using MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetV2 models, with the process producing an accuracy curve, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: The EfficientNetV2 model showed a steep increase in validation accuracy early in the iterations, plateauing at a score of 0.71. According to the confusion matrix, this model's testing accuracy for diagnosing nonneoplastic and premalignant/malignant lesions was 64% and 80% respectively. Conversely, the MobileNetV3 model exhibited a more gradual increase, reaching a plateau at a validation accuracy of 0.70. The MobileNetV3 model's testing accuracy for diagnosing non-neoplastic and premalignant/malignant lesions, according to the confusion matrix, was 64% and 82% respectively. Conclusions: Our proof-of-concept study effectively demonstrated the potential accuracy of AI software in distinguishing malignant lesions. This could play a vital role in remote screenings for populations with limited access to dental practitioners. However, the discrepancies between the classification of images and the results of "non-malignant lesions" calls for further refinement of the models and the classification system used. Clinical significance: The findings of this study indicate that AI software has the potential to aid in the identification or screening of malignant oral lesions. Further improvements are required to enhance accuracy in classifying non-malignant lesions.

AB STUDY QUESTION Does Cushing's syndrome (CS) differently affect the gonadotrope axis and testicular functions (GA/TF) according to the hypercortisolism intensity and underlying etiology?SUMMARY ANSWER Endogenous cortisol excess caused by CS leads to varying degrees of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) with more severe GA/TF impairment and altered spermatogenesis in men with intense hypercortisolism associated with paraneoplastic/ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion (EAS).WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY CS is very rarely studied in men due to its lower prevalence in men than in women. In a few old reports focusing exclusively on a limited number of men with Cushing's disease (CD), the occurrence of hypogonadism was reported. However, a detailed assessment of the impact of CS on the GA/TF in a significant series of patients has not been performed. Yet, hypogonadism could worsen CS-associated comorbidities such as osteoporosis and myopathy. To date, the full spectrum of GA/TF impairment in men with CS of different etiologies and intensity remains unknown.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION In this monocentric study, 89 men with CS diagnosed at a tertiary endocrine university center (Bicetre, Paris Saclay) between January 1990 and July 2021 were evaluated and compared to 40 normal men of similar age.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The CS patient cohort of 89 men included 51 with CD, 29 with EAS and 9 with CS of adrenal origin i.e. (ACTH-independent CS (AI-CS)). They all had frank hypercortisolism, with increased 24 h-urinary-free cortisol (24 h-UFC) in two separate samples. A case-control study was performed focusing on pituitary gonadotrope function and testicular sex steroids and peptides. An additional set of six CS men had an evaluation including semen analysis. In a subgroup of 20 men with available data after CS remission, a longitudinal analysis was conducted to assess the reversibility of GA/TF defects.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Compared to controls, men with CS had significantly lower total testosterone (TT), bioavailable TT, and free TT (P < 0.0001). Hypogonadism, defined as serum TT levels <3.0 ng/ml, was present in 83% of men with EAS, in 61% of men with CD, and in 33% of men with AI-CS. Low-normal LH concentrations in the included men with hypercortisolism indicated HH. Serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels were moderately decreased in men with CD (P = 0.01 vs controls). Among the CS men, those with EAS had significantly lower TT, LH, and FSH levels than those with CD or AI-CS. When compared to controls, patients with EAS were the only group exhibiting a significant decrease in both serum FSH (P = 0.002) and the testicular peptides inhibin B (P < 0.0001) and anti-Mullerian hormone (P = 0.003). Serum INSL3 levels were significantly lower in men with CD than in the controls (P = 0.03). Of note, 24 h-UFC and ACTH were inversely and significantly associated with the majority of reproductive hormones including LH, FSH, TT, and inhibin B. Following successful curative therapy, reproductive assessment at a mean of 6.0 & PLUSMN; 4.3 years showed a significant increase in serum TT (P < 0.0001) and plasma LH (P = 0.02) levels, indicating a reversal of HH in 75% of the affected males. Among the six patients with available semen analysis, the two EAS cases exhibited a decrease in Sertoli cell peptides associated with a severe oligozoospermia, which completely normalized following removal of the source of hypercortisolism.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The potential bias due to the retrospective design is counteracted by the analysis of the largest male CS cohort to date as well as the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Due to the low number of patients with semen analysis in this study, further research is needed to unravel the full spectrum of spermatogenesis defects in men with CS.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This work reveals the variable spectrum of reproductive impact in men with CS. We demonstrate that GA/TF impairment depends on the intensity of hypercortisolism which in turn is related to the underlying etiology. The causal link between hypercortisolism and GA/TF impairment was attested by its reversibility in most patients after CS remission. The wider implications of our findings lie in the potential generalization to a much commoner entity, iatrogenic CS due to chronic exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S) Several research grants were attributed to J.Y.: (i) a grant from Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique (PHRC # P081212 HYPOPROTEO); (ii) a grant from the French Association of Patients with Adrenal Diseases ('Association surrenales'); and (iii) independent Investigator Research Grants from HRA Pharma, Novartis and Recordati Pharma.

AB The effectiveness and precision of disease diagnosis and treatment have increased, thanks to developments in clinical imaging over the past few decades. Science is developing and progressing steadily in imaging modalities, and effective outcomes are starting to show up as a result of the shorter scanning periods needed as well as the higher-resolution images generated. The choice of one clinical device over another is influenced by technical disparities among the equipment, such as detection medium, shorter scan time, patient comfort, cost-effectiveness, accessibility, greater sensitivity and specificity, and spatial resolution. Lately, computational algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, have been incorporated with diagnostic and treatment techniques, including imaging systems. AI is a discipline comprised of multiple computational and mathematical models. Its applications aided in manipulating sophisticated data in imaging processes and increased imaging tests' accuracy and precision during diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) along with their corresponding radiation detectors have been reviewed in this study. This review will provide an in-depth explanation of the above-mentioned imaging modalities as well as the radiation detectors that are their essential components. From the early development of these medical instruments till now, various modifications and improvements have been done and more is yet to be established for better performance which calls for a necessity to capture the available information and record the gaps to be filled for better future advances.

ID FLAME DETECTION; COLOR
AB BackgroundForests cover nearly one-third of the Earth's land and are some of our most biodiverse ecosystems. Due to climate change, these essential habitats are endangered by increasing wildfires. Wildfires are not just a risk to the environment, but they also pose public health risks. Given these issues, there is an indispensable need for efficient and early detection methods. Conventional detection approaches fall short due to spatial limitations and manual feature engineering, which calls for the exploration and development of data-driven deep learning solutions. This paper, in this regard, proposes 'FireXnet', a tailored deep learning model designed for improved efficiency and accuracy in wildfire detection. FireXnet is tailored to have a lightweight architecture that exhibits high accuracy with significantly less training and testing time. It contains considerably reduced trainable and non-trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for resource-constrained devices. To make the FireXnet model visually explainable and trustable, a powerful explainable artificial intelligence (AI) tool, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) has been incorporated. It interprets FireXnet's decisions by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction. Furthermore, the performance of FireXnet is compared against five pre-trained models - VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2 - to benchmark its efficiency. For a fair comparison, transfer learning and fine-tuning have been applied to the aforementioned models to retrain the models on our dataset.ResultsThe test accuracy of the proposed FireXnet model is 98.42%, which is greater than all other models used for comparison. Furthermore, results of reliability parameters confirm the model's reliability, i.e., a confidence interval of [0.97, 1.00] validates the certainty of the proposed model's estimates and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.98 proves that decisions of FireXnet are in considerable accordance with the given data.ConclusionThe integration of the robust feature extraction of FireXnet with the transparency of explainable AI using SHAP enhances the model's interpretability and allows for the identification of key characteristics triggering wildfire detections. Extensive experimentation reveals that in addition to being accurate, FireXnet has reduced computational complexity due to considerably fewer training and non-training parameters and has significantly fewer training and testing times.
   AntecedentesLos bosques cubren cerca de un tercio de la superficie terrestre y representan unos de nuestros ecosistemas mas diversos. Debido al cambio climatico, estos habitats esenciales estan en peligro por el incremento de los incendios. Los incendios no solo representan un riesgo para el ambiente, sino tambien ponen en riesgo la salud publica. Dados estos temas, hay una necesidad indispensable para desarrollar metodos eficientes de deteccion temprana. Los enfoques convencionales de deteccion son de corto alcance debido a las limitaciones espaciales y las caracteristicas ingenieriles de procesamiento manual, lo que llama a explorar y desarrollar soluciones basadas en la multiplicidad de procesamiento de datos aplicando el aprendizaje profundo (deep learning). Este trabajo, en ese sentido, propone el 'FireXnet', un modelo ajustado de deep learning disenado para mejorar la eficiencia y exactitud en la deteccion de incendios. FireXnet fue configurado para tener una arquitectura ligera que exhibe una gran exactitud con menor entrenamiento y tiempo de prueba. Contiene un numero considerablemente reducido de parametros entrenables y no entrenables, lo que lo hace adecuado para dispositivos limitados en recursos. Para hacer el modelo FireXnet visualmente explicable y confiable, fue incorporada una poderosa herramienta explicativa de la inteligencia artificial (AI) SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations). Ella interpreta las decisiones de FireXnet computando la contribucion de cada caracteristica a la prediccion. Ademas, la performance de FireXnet fue comparada con otros cinco modelos pre-entrenados - VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, Inception V3, DenseNet201, y MobileNet2-para comparar su eficiencia. Para una buena comparacion, el aprendizaje transferido y su sintonia fina fue aplicada a los modelos mencionados para re-entrenar los modelos en nuestro conjunto de datos.ResultadosLa prueba de exactitud del modelo propuesto FireXnet es del 99.53%, lo que es mayor que todos los modelos usados para comparacion. Ademas, la confiabilidad de los parametros tambien confirma su confiabilidad (i.e. intervalo de confianza de 0.98, 1.00), lo que valida la certidumbre de la estimacion de los modelos propuestos y un coeficiente Cohen & PRIME;s kappa de 0.99, prueba que las decisiones de FireXnet estan de acuerdo con los datos proporcionados.ConclusionLa integracion de la robusta presentacion extraida de FireXnet con la explicable transparencia de la AI usando SHAP mejora la interpretacion del modelo y permite la identificacion de las caracteristicas clave que disparan las detecciones de incendios. La experimentacion extensiva revela que adicionalmente a ser exacto, el modelo FireXnet pudo reducir la complejidad computacional debido a considerablemente menores parametros de entrenamiento y no entrenamiento y significativamente menores tiempos de entrenamiento y testeos.

AB CRISPR-Cas9 tools have transformed genetic manipulation capabilities in the laboratory. Empirical rules-of-thumb have been developed for only a narrow range of model organisms, and mechanistic underpinnings for sgRNA efficiency remain poorly understood. This work establishes a novel feature set and new public resource, produced with quantum chemical tensors, for interpreting and predicting sgRNA efficiency. Feature engineering for sgRNA efficiency is performed using an explainable-artificial intelligence model: iterative Random Forest (iRF). By encoding quantitative attributes of position-specific sequences for Escherichia coli sgRNAs, we identify important traits for sgRNA design in bacterial species. Additionally, we show that expanding positional encoding to quantum descriptors of base-pair, dimer, trimer, and tetramer sequences captures intricate interactions in local and neighboring nucleotides of the target DNA. These features highlight variation in CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA dynamics between E. coli and H. sapiens genomes. These novel encodings of sgRNAs enhance our understanding of the elaborate quantum biological processes involved in CRISPR-Cas9 machinery.

AB With the recent rapid technological advance, second language (L2) educators have increasingly incorporated technologies into writing pedagogy. Two of the major technologies to promote L2 writing are e-portfolios and automated written corrective feedback (AWCF). Notably, feedback-rich portfolios facilitate L2 learners' self-regulation and writing development. In addition, AWCF itself can help them notice the gap between their interlanguage and the target language (i.e., the AWCF) in the writing process and incorporate the noticed language features. However, fewer technologies have been developed to maximize the combined use of e-portfolios and AWCF. This review proposes that the use of Notion as an e-portfolio platform and its embedded artificial intelligence (AI) (i.e., Notion AI) as an AWCF generator has significant potential to address such issues uniquely and seamlessly. Notion is a freemium application where users can manage their tasks on one platform individually and collaboratively, while Notion AI is an AI-powered writing assistant that edits users' texts in terms of lexico-grammar, cohesion and structure. This technology review reports an overview of the complementary use of Notion and Notion AI and discusses their affordances and limitations for L2 writing pedagogy.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB In recent years, smart healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI)-aided diagnostics, and automated surgical robots are just a few of the innovations that have emerged and gained popularity with the advent of Healthcare 4.0. Such technologies are powered by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), which are preferable for disease diagnosis, identifying patterns, prescribing treatments, and forecasting diseases like stroke prediction, cancer prediction and so forth. Nevertheless, much data is needed for AI, ML, and DL-based systems to train effectively and provide the desired outcomes. Further, it raises concerns about data privacy, security, communication overhead, regulatory compliance and so forth. Federated learning (FL) is a technology that protects data security and privacy by limiting data sharing and utilizing model information of distributed systems to enhance performance. However, existing approaches are traditionally verified on pre-established datasets that fail to capture real-life applicability. Therefore, this study proposes an AI-enabled stroke prediction architecture consisting of FL based on the artificial neural network (ANN) model using data from actual stroke cases. This architecture can be implemented on healthcare-based wearable devices (WD) for real-time use as it is effective, precise, and computationally affordable. In order to continuously enhance the performance of the global model, the proposed FL-based architecture aggregates the optimizer weights of many clients using a fifth-generation (5G) communication channel. Then, the performance of the proposed FL-based architecture is studied based on multiple parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, bit error rate, and spectral noise. It outperforms the traditional approaches regarding accuracy, which is 5% to 10% higher.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a rapidly developing field. Its use can improve diagnosis and therapy in many areas of medicine. Despite this enormous progress, many physicians perceive it as a black box and are skeptical about it. This review will present the basics of machine learning. Different classifications of artificial intelligence, such as supervised versus unsupervised and discriminative versus generative AI, are given. Analogies to human intelligence are discussed as far as algorithms are oriented toward it. In the second step, the most common models like random forest, k-means clustering, convolutional neural network, and transformers will be presented in a way that the underlying idea can be understood. Corresponding medical applications in cardiovascular medicine will be named for all models, respectively. The overview is intended to show that the term artificial intelligence covers a wide range of different concepts. It should help physicians understand the principles of AI to make up one's minds about its application in cardiology. It should also enable them to evaluate results obtained with AI's help critically.

AB The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is accelerating rapidly. Beyond the urge for technological optimization, public perceptions and preferences regarding the application of such technologies remain poorly understood. Risk and benefit perceptions of novel technologies are key drivers for successful implementation. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the factors that condition these perceptions. In this study, we draw on the risk perception and human-AI interaction literature to examine how explicit (i.e., deliberate) and implicit (i.e., automatic) comparative trust associations with AI versus physicians, and knowledge about AI, relate to likelihood perceptions of risks and benefits of AI in healthcare and preferences for the integration of AI in healthcare. We use survey data (N = 378) to specify a path model. Results reveal that the path for implicit comparative trust associations on relative preferences for AI over physicians is only significant through risk, but not through benefit perceptions. This finding is reversed for AI knowledge. Explicit comparative trust associations relate to AI preference through risk and benefit perceptions. These findings indicate that risk perceptions of AI in healthcare might be driven more strongly by affect-laden factors than benefit perceptions, which in turn might depend more on reflective cognition. Implications of our findings and directions for future research are discussed considering the conceptualization of trust as heuristic and dual-process theories of judgment and decision-making. Regarding the design and implementation of AI-based healthcare technologies, our findings suggest that a holistic integration of public viewpoints is warranted.

AB Multiple tools exist for separately simulating and estimating the parameters of system dynamics models. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used to estimate the parameters of system dynamics models. The development of modeling tools and advanced environments has resulted in great benefits to the community at large. The incorporation of AI tools into system dynamics presents opportunities for expanding on current decision-making methods. As systems become complex, the need to incorporate evidence-based data-driven methods increases. By integrating system dynamics tools and facilitating AI and system dynamics simulation in an integrated environment, model parameters can be estimated with the latest data, and the integrity of the model can be retained effectively. This provides an advantage to the efficiency and capabilities of the system dynamics model and its analysis. This paper presents a general methodology to incorporate regression AI into system dynamics models for simulation and analysis. To demonstrate the validity of the methodology, a case study involving a susceptible-infected-recovered model and empirical data from the COVID-19 pandemic is performed using support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and random forests.

ID CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINE
AB Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a widespread disease with only 50%-60% 5-year survival. Individuals with potentially malignant precursor lesions are at high risk.Methods: Survival could be increased by effective, affordable, and simple screening methods, along with a shift from incisional tissue biopsies to non-invasive brush biopsies for cytology diagnosis, which are easy to perform in primary care. Along with the explainable, fast, and objective artificial intelligence characterisation of cells through deep learning, an easy-to-use, rapid, and cost-effective methodology for finding high-risk lesions is achievable. The collection of cytology samples offers the further opportunity of explorative genomic analysis.Results: Our prospective multicentre study of patients with leukoplakia yields a vast number of oral keratinocytes. In addition to cytopathological analysis, whole-slide imaging and the training of deep neural networks, samples are analysed according to a single-cell RNA sequencing protocol, enabling mapping of the entire keratinocyte transcriptome. Mapping the changes in the genetic profile, based on mRNA expression, facilitates the identification of biomarkers that predict cancer transformation.Conclusion: This position paper highlights non-invasive methods for identifying patients with oral mucosal lesions at risk of malignant transformation. Reliable non-invasive methods for screening at-risk individuals bring the early diagnosis of OSCC within reach. The use of biomarkers to decide on a targeted therapy is most likely to improve the outcome. With the large-scale collection of samples following patients over time, combined with genomic analysis and modern machine-learning-based approaches for finding patterns in data, this path holds great promise.

AB The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected more than half a billion people worldwide and caused more than 6 million deaths since 2019. The responsible virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily affects the lungs, but it has multisystemic effects. It is well known that dysfunction of multiple endocrine organs may occur during or after COVID-19. Impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is of utmost importance as it may lead to death if went undiagnosed. SARS-CoV-2 may cause both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiencies (AI). The clinical manifestations of AI are generally non-specific and might be attributed to the complications caused by the infection itself. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms were explained by the immunogenic, vascular effects of the infection or the direct effects of the virus. The diagnosis of AI in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is not straightforward. There is lack of consensus on the cut-off values of basal serum cortisol levels and stimulation tests during the disease. Here we review the literature with a special regard on the evaluation of HPA axis in patients with COVID-19. We conclude that the possibility of AI should always be kept in mind when dealing with patients with COVID-19, and repeated basal cortisol measurements and the ACTH stimulation test results could guide the clinician during the diagnostic process.

AB IntroductionRecent neurosurgical applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated its potential in surgical planning and anatomical measurement. We aimed to evaluate the performance of an AI planning software application on screw length/diameter selection and insertion accuracy in comparison with freehand surgery.MethodsA total of 45 patients with 208 pedicle screw placements on thoracolumbar segments were included in this analysis. The novel AI planning software was developed based on a deep learning model. AI-based pedicle screw placements were selected on the basis of preoperative computed tomography (CT) data, and freehand surgery screw placements were observed based on postoperative CT data. The performance of AI pedicle screw placements was evaluated on the components of screw length, diameter, and Gertzbein grade in comparison with the results achieved by freehand surgery.ResultsAmong 208 pedicle screw placements, the average screw length/diameters selected by the AI model and used in freehand surgery were 48.65 & PLUSMN; 5.99 mm/7.39 & PLUSMN; 0.42 mm and 44.78 & PLUSMN; 2.99 mm/6.1 & PLUSMN; 0.27 mm, respectively. Among AI screw placements, 85.1% were classified as Gertzbein Grade A (no cortical pedicle breach); among free-hand surgery placements, 64.9% were classified as Gertzbein Grade A.ConclusionThe novel AI planning software application could provide an accessible and safe pedicle screw placement strategy in comparison with traditional freehand pedicle screw placement strategies. The choices of pedicle screw dimensional parameters made by the model, including length and diameter, may provide potential inspiration for real clinical discretion.

AB Machine learning has successfully achieved the ultimate goal to mimic intelligent human behavior in data-abundance problems but is often hampered in data scarcity problems. To tackle this, computer vision presents a low-cost solution by introducing a fundamental concept called "Few-Shot Learning (FSL)" which helps to bridge the gap between AI, ML, and human-like learning. FSL makes learning models to generalize in low-shot regimes, hence avoiding strenuous human tasks like the collection of huge datasets, arduous labeling, or preprocessing. Data modality, domain adaptation, domain shifts, and discrepancy of the implementation details among multiple FSL algorithms are major challenges and of great interest in FSL models. Metric-based models successfully attempt to learn within tasks, however, they often fail to generalize across tasks due to the large disparity of feature distributions. In our study, we introduce a class-covariance based metric-learner that adopts Mahalanobis distance as a metric function to enhance few-shot classification performance significantly within and across domains. Feature-wise modulation layers are also introduced and integrated with a feature encoder at multiple steps to augment and diversify the distribution of image features which makes our model learning-to-generalize across domains as well. Meta-learning based optimization algorithm is adopted to fine-tune the hyper-parameters involved. Evaluation and analysis of experimental procedures compare favorably against other state-of-the-art FSL methods and justify the use of a covariance-based metric model and learned feature-wise modulation layers.

AB IntroductionMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising alternative to standard x-ray fluoroscopy for the guidance of cardiac catheterization procedures as it enables soft tissue visualization, avoids ionizing radiation and provides improved hemodynamic data. MRI-guided cardiac catheterization procedures currently require frequent manual tracking of the imaging plane during navigation to follow the tip of a gadolinium-filled balloon wedge catheter, which unnecessarily prolongs and complicates the procedures. Therefore, real-time automatic image-based detection of the catheter balloon has the potential to improve catheter visualization and navigation through automatic slice tracking.MethodsIn this study, an automatic, parameter-free, deep-learning-based post-processing pipeline was developed for real-time detection of the catheter balloon. A U-Net architecture with a ResNet-34 encoder was trained on semi-artificial images for the segmentation of the catheter balloon. Post-processing steps were implemented to guarantee a unique estimate of the catheter tip coordinates. This approach was evaluated retrospectively in 7 patients (6M and 1F, age = 7 & PLUSMN; 5 year) who underwent an MRI-guided right heart catheterization procedure with all images acquired in an orientation unseen during training.ResultsThe overall accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the proposed catheter tracking strategy over all 7 patients were 98.4 & PLUSMN; 2.0%, 99.9 & PLUSMN; 0.2% and 95.4 & PLUSMN; 5.5%, respectively. The computation time of the deep-learning-based segmentation step was & SIM;10 ms/image, indicating its compatibility with real-time constraints.ConclusionDeep-learning-based catheter balloon tracking is feasible, accurate, parameter-free, and compatible with real-time conditions. Online integration of the technique and its evaluation in a larger patient cohort are now warranted to determine its benefit during MRI-guided cardiac catheterization.

AB IntroductionCerebrovascular diseases are known to cause significant morbidity and mortality to the general population. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, prompt clinical evaluation and radiographic interpretation are both essential in optimizing clinical management and in triaging patients for critical and potentially life-saving neurosurgical interventions. With recent advancements in the domains of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), many AI and ML algorithms have been developed to further optimize the diagnosis and subsequent management of cerebrovascular disease. Despite such advances, further studies are needed to substantively evaluate both the diagnostic accuracy and feasibility of these techniques for their application in clinical practice. This review aims to analyze the current use of AI and MI algorithms in the diagnosis of, and clinical decision making for cerebrovascular disease, and to discuss both the feasibility and future applications of utilizing such algorithms.MethodsWe review the use of AI and ML algorithms to assist clinicians in the diagnosis and management of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). After identifying the most widely used algorithms, we provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy and effectiveness of these algorithms in practice.ResultsThe incorporation of AI and ML algorithms for cerebrovascular patients has demonstrated improvements in time to detection of intracranial pathologies such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and infarcts. For ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, commercial AI software platforms such as RapidAI and Viz.AI have bene implemented into routine clinical practice at many stroke centers to expedite the detection of infarcts and ICH, respectively. Such algorithms and neural networks have also been analyzed for use in prognostication for such cerebrovascular pathologies. These include predicting outcomes for ischemic stroke patients, hematoma expansion, risk of aneurysm rupture, bleeding of AVMs, and in predicting outcomes following interventions such as risk of occlusion for various endovascular devices. Preliminary analyses have yielded promising sensitivities when AI and ML are used in concert with imaging modalities and a multidisciplinary team of health care providers.ConclusionThe implementation of AI and ML algorithms to supplement clinical practice has conferred a high degree of accuracy, efficiency, and expedited detection in the clinical and radiographic evaluation and management of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, AVMs, and aneurysms. Such algorithms have been explored for further purposes of prognostication for these conditions, with promising preliminary results. Further studies should evaluate the longitudinal implementation of such techniques into hospital networks and residency programs to supplement clinical practice, and the extent to which these techniques improve patient care and clinical outcomes in the long-term.

AB Microorganism-mediated biohydrometallurgy, a sustainable approach for metal recovery from ores, relies on the metabolic activity of acidophilic bacteria. Acidithiobacillia with sulfur/iron-oxidizing capacities are extensively studied and applied in biohydrometallurgy-related processes. However, only 14 distinct proteins from Acidithiobacillia have experimentally determined structures currently available. This significantly hampers in-depth investigations of Acidithiobacillia's structure-based biological mechanisms pertaining to its relevant biohydrometallurgical processes. To address this issue, we employed a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach, with a median model confidence of 0.80, to perform high-quality full-chain structure predictions on the pan-proteome (10,458 proteins) of the type strain Acidithiobacillia. Additionally, we conducted various case studies on de novo protein structural prediction, including sulfate transporter and iron oxidase, to demonstrate how accurate structure predictions and gene co-occurrence networks can contribute to the development of mechanistic insights and hypotheses regarding sulfur and iron utilization proteins. Furthermore, for the unannotated proteins that constitute 35.8% of the Acidithiobacillia proteome, we employed the deep-learning algorithm DeepFRI to make structure-based functional predictions. As a result, we successfully obtained gene ontology (GO) terms for 93.6% of these previously unknown proteins. This study has a significant impact on improving protein structure and function predictions, as well as developing state-of-the-art techniques for high-throughput analysis of large proteomic data.

This affects women's empowerment and the development of effective livestock businesses.MethodsThis study addresses the question: How do women's empowerment and gender norms affect women's engagement in livestock business? To respond, this study explores how women attempt to negotiate gender norms in order to create a niche for their agribusiness, and thereby to empower themselves. Since gender norms are diverse, research was undertaken in 2021 with agripreneurs running dairy-related businesses in two regions of Tanzania. Gender-disaggregated focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and individual interviews were carried out in Kilimanjaro and Tanga regions which had been target sites for the bigger Maziwa Zaidi Phase II project in Tanzania. In total, 24 women dairy farmers, 25 men dairy farmers, 20 women agripreneurs and 22 men agripreneurs involved in selling feeds, milk collection and agro-veterinary goods and services such as artificial insemination and livestock extension participated in the FGDs. Twelve women and 16 men were interviewed as KIIs while 12 women and 15 men were interviewed individually.Results and DiscussionThe findings show that women agripreneurs are active in selling milk and earning an income, and a few women provide AI services. However, local gender norms significantly reduce potential gains. Normative sanctions are applied to women who are perceived to be moving beyond acceptable gender norms in their efforts to establish their dairy related livelihoods. Yet this picture is not uniform. The presence of traditionally more favorable local gender norms towards engagement in smallholder dairy related businesses allows women in the Kilimanjaro Region to openly exercise more decision-making power and secure more benefits compared to women in Tanga Region where local norms largely limited women's engagement because dairying is a rather novel concept and was introduced in the 1990s as a men's income generation enterprise.Our own findings indicate that local patriarchal contexts remain powerful in both study sites. However with sustained empowerment efforts, women and men fairly express an understanding of empowerment as a process, involving building capacity, supporting, creating an enabling environment for achieving of one's goals. Women note that an empowered woman faces more barriers than an empowered man because if married, she has to consult with her husband prior to making big investments. Empowered men are however free to do as they like with their resources. Patriarchal norms guiding social ordering in Tanzania therefore place a cap on achievement as well as expression of empowerment by women. Moreover, through gender norms gatekeeping, significant relations such as husbands and community members can also act as empowerment gatekeepers reining in women's expression and experience of empowerment, especially if her husband is economically disempowered while she is.Results and DiscussionThe findings show that women agripreneurs are active in selling milk and earning an income, and a few women provide AI services.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB The development of large language models (LLMs) is a recent success in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI). They are computer models able to perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including content generation, question answering, or language translation. In recent months, a growing number of studies aimed to assess their potential applications in the field of medicine, including cancer care. In this mini review, we described the present published evidence for using LLMs in oncology. All the available studies assessed ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI, alone or compared to other LLMs, such as Google Bard, Chatsonic, and Perplexity. Although ChatGPT could provide adequate information on the screening or the management of specific solid tumors, it also demonstrated a significant error rate and a tendency toward providing obsolete data. Therefore, an accurate, expert-driven verification process remains mandatory to avoid the potential for misinformation and incorrect evidence. Overall, although this new generative AI-based technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine, including that of cancer care, it will be necessary to develop rules to guide the application of these tools to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

AB The dryland is one of the most important land ecosystems on the planet, and its changes are closely bound up with one-third of the world's population. Investigating dryland climate change during the Last Interglacial (LIG; & SIM;127 ka ago) can advance our knowledge of dryland climate behaviors in an orbitally-induced warmer-than-present scenario. Based on the multiple model outputs from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 4, we suggest that the dryland areas during the LIG are 37% wetter than that during the preindustrial period as measured by the aridity index (AI), and 37% of the preindustrial drylands correspondingly convert to wetter subtypes. Spatially, there are hemispheric differences with drylands wetting and contracting in the Northern Hemisphere but desiccating and expanding in the Southern Hemisphere. Further diagnosis indicates that the altered precipitation is the dominant contributor to more than 72% of the AI changes, and the precipitation change is mainly attributed to the orbitally-induced redistribution of incoming insolation and heat. The secondary factor is the relative humidity change, exaggerating the AI changes in the same direction as the precipitation does. The simulation agrees reasonably with reconstructions for most regions, except Australia and southern Africa. The simulated changes in dryland aridity and the mechanism differ from that in future warming scenarios, so we claim that the LIG as a potential analogue for a warmer future does not fully hold for the dryland climate.

AB Our objective was to compare reproductive outcomes of primiparous lactating Holstein cows of different genetic merit for fertility submitted for insemination with management programs that prioritized artificial insemination (AI) at detected estrus (AIE) or timed AI (TAI). Moreover, we aimed to determine whether sub-groups of cows with different fertility potential would present a distinct response to the reproductive manage-ment strategies compared. Lactating primiparous Hol-stein cows (n = 6 commercial farms) were stratified into high (Hi-Fert), medium (Med-Fert), and low (Lo-Fert) genetic fertility groups (FG) based on a Reproduction Index value calculated from multiple genomic-enhanced predicted transmitting abilities. Within herd and FG, cows were randomly assigned either to a program that prioritized TAI and had an extended voluntary waiting period (P-TAI; n = 1,338) or another that prioritized AIE (P-AIE; n = 1,416) and used TAI for cows, not AIE. Cows in P-TAI received first service by TAI at 84 & PLUSMN; 3 d in milk (DIM) after a Double-Ovsynch protocol, were AIE if detected in estrus after a previous AI, and received TAI after an Ovsynch-56 protocol at 35 & PLUSMN; 3 d after a previous AI if a corpus luteum (CL) was visual-ized at nonpregnancy diagnosis (NPD) 32 & PLUSMN; 3 d after AI. Cows with no CL visualized at NPD received TAI at 42 & PLUSMN; 3 d after AI after an Ovsynch-56 protocol with progesterone supplementation (P4-Ovsynch). Cows in P-AIE were eligible for AIE after a PGF2 & alpha; treatment at 53 & PLUSMN; 3 DIM and after a previous AI. Cows not AIE by 74 & PLUSMN; 3 DIM or by NPD 32 & PLUSMN; 3 d after AI received P4-Ovsynch for TAI at 74 & PLUSMN; 3 DIM or 42 & PLUSMN; 3 d after AI. Binary data were analyzed with logistic regression, count data with Poisson regression, continuous data by ANOVA, and time to event data by Cox's proportional hazard regression. Pregnancy per AI (P/AI) to first service was greater for cows in the Hi-Fert (59.8%) than the Med-Fert (53.6%) and Lo-Fert (47.7%) groups, and for the P-TAI (58.7%) than the P-AIE (48.7%) treat-ment. Overall, P/AI for all second and subsequent AI combined did not differ by treatment (P-TAI = 45.2%; P-AIE = 44.5%) or FG (Hi-Fert = 46.1%; Med-Fert = 46.0%; Lo-Fert = 42.4%). The hazard of pregnancy after calving was greater for the P-AIE than the P-TAI treatment [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.37)], and for the Hi-Fert than the Med-Fert (HR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.28) and Lo-Fert (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.49) groups. More cows in the Hi -Fert (91.2%) than the Med-Fert (88.4%) and Lo-Fert (85.8%) groups were pregnant at 200 DIM. Within FG, the hazard of pregnancy was greater for the P-AIE than the P-TAI treatment for the Hi-Fert (HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22 to 1.64) and Med-Fert (HR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.46) groups but not for the Lo-Fert group (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.31). We conclude that primiparous Holstein cows of superior genetic merit for fertility had better reproductive performance than cows of inferior genetic merit for fertility, regardless of the type of reproductive management used. In addition, the effect of programs that prioritized AIE or TAI on re-productive performance for cows of superior or inferior genetic merit for fertility depended on the outcomes evaluated. Thus, programs that prioritize AIE or TAI could be used to affect certainoutcomes of reproduc-tive performance or management.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to compare the condylar head displacement (CHD) after bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy (BSSO) between different degrees of mandibular advancement in skeletal class II patients and to evaluate whether the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function would be affected.
   Patients and methods: Fifty-nine patients (118 condyles) were included in this retrospective study and were divided into three groups based on the distance of mandibular advancement. The CHD in three directions, x (sagittal direction), y (coronal direction), and z (axial direction), was measured before operation (T0), immediately after operation (T1), and at least 6 months after operation (T2), and the TMJ function of patients was followed up and scored using the Helkimo index system. All the abovementioned data were statistically analyzed, and p < 0.05 was considered the statistical difference standard.
   Result: During the BSSO surgery, the condyle was predominantly displaced in a lateral, posterior, and superior direction whenever in T1 and T2, even though the degree of CHD was different. Regarding the amount of CHD, the large advancement group was higher than the other two groups in T1 and T2 (p<0.01). The Helkimo index scores of the three groups were evaluated, and there was no significant statistical difference between the Ai and Di index of the three groups.
   Conclusion: In our center, CHD occurred in lateral, posterior, and superior directions following mandibular advancement in skeletal class II patients, with a positive correlation between the CHD and the mandibular advancement; however, the TMJ function of the three groups did not show significant differences.

TI Artificial intelligence in rare disease diagnosis and treatment
SO CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Review; Early Access
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) utilization in health care has grown over the past few years. It also has demonstrated potential in improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. Some types of AI, such as machine learning, allow for the efficient analysis of vast datasets, identifying patterns, and generating key insights. Predictions can then be made for medical diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations. The use of AI can bypass some conventional limitations associated with rare diseases. Namely, it can optimize traditional randomized control trials, and may eventually reduce costs for drug research and development. Recent advancements have enabled researchers to train models based on large datasets and then fine-tune these models on smaller datasets typically associated with rare diseases. In this mini-review, we discuss recent advancements in AI and how AI can be applied to streamline rare disease diagnosis and optimize treatment.

AB Due to its strategic significance in the area of smart transportation to facilitate Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have grown very popular in recent years. The rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road has also led to the development of heterogeneous, large-scale, and highly dynamic VANETs, which introduce difficulty to fulfill the stringent requirements, which include low latency, high mobility, top security, and massive connectivity of the 5G network. Research works in VANETs mainly focus on message transmission within strict delay requirements based on different applications, data privacy and security. In this respect, a number of studies have been carried out by the researchers that propose models and solutions linked to the enhancement of VANET from several aspects, including applications, Quality of Service (QoS), security, physical layer fading, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, Medium Access Control (MAC), and routing protocols. These factors serve as the driving force for this study's thorough examination of VANETs, which includes information on specific applications, QoS, channel fading, MAC protocols, channel access mechanisms, routing protocols, security, and difficulties. None of the surveys in existence today address all critical aspects of VANET in a single survey. In this paper, a complete taxonomy of VANETs has been provided based on various issues. First, an overview of VANET is presented with different applications. Then, QoS in VANETs and different proposed MAC protocols are discussed. Channel fading and access mechanisms are presented. After that, routing protocols, security, and clustering in VANETs are provided. AI approaches proposed in VANET are also summarized. Finally, a discussion of future research direction for all aspects is presented. This article might be used as a guide or a point of reference while designing and creating applications, networking and communication systems, and data security for VANETs.

AB Deep Learning approaches are able to automatically extract relevant features from the input data and capture nonlinear relationships between the input and output. In this work, we present the GRID-derived AI (GrAId) descriptors, a simple modification to GRID MIFs that facilitate their use in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build Deep Learning models in a rotationally, conformationally, and alignment-independent approach we are calling DeepGRID. To our knowledge, this is the first time that GRID MIFs have been combined with CNNs in a Deep Learning approach. We applied the approach to build regression and classification models for blood-brain barrier permeation, an important factor when designing CNS drugs and conversely when designing to avoid off-target effects for CNS-inactive drugs. The VolSurf approach was one of the first to successfully model this property from three-dimensional structures, using descriptors derived from their GRID Molecular Interaction Fields (MIFs) in combination with PLS. We compared the DeepGRID models with others built using the hand-crafted VolSurf descriptors in combination with both PLS and Random Forest (RF). Both the DeepGRID and RF regression models performed best according to the % of compounds with a Geometric Mean Fold Error (GMFE) within 2-fold of the experimental data. Applying these regression models as classifiers, for the smaller 332 and 416 compound data sets all models performed well with ROC AUC values of & SIM;0.9 on the external test set. For the larger 2105 compound data set, the DeepGRID classifier performed the best with an AUC of 0.87 on the external test set with the RF model having an AUC of 0.84 and the original VolSurf lgBB model having an AUC of 0.83.

AB Solid electrolytes (SEs) are crucial materials to realize highly safe and practical all-solid-state Li+-ion batteries. Here, we performed a large-scale computational SE screening on a chemical space of >10 000 Li-rich inverse-perovskite (ip) compounds with tetragonal and cubic structures by high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) and AI-driven methods. A total of 1413 novel candidate compounds were predicted to be synthesizable based on thermodynamic decomposition energy (E-d) and machine-learned experimental synthesis likelihood (L-s). These compounds were further screened using a Pareto-front approximation set of a multiobjective Bayesian optimization tasks for k = 3 DFT-calculated SE properties (f (k) , with k = 1, 2, and 3): (i) electrochemical window from electronic band gap energy (f (1): E (g)), (ii) chemical stability by reaction with moisture (f( 2): E (h)), and (iii) 400 K bulk Li+-ion conductivity (f (3): ?). As a result, the compound list was reduced down to 24 candidate ip SEs, and examples include Cm Li8O2Cl3Br (E-d = 0, L-s > 0.5, E-g = 4.74 eV, E- h = -33.22 kJ/mol, and ? = 9.0 x 10(-4) S/cm), Amm2 Li8OSCl4 (E (d) = 0.070 eV/atom, L (s )> 0.5, E-g = 4.14 eV, E- h = -40.70 kJ/mol, and ? = 9.2 x 10(-2) S/cm), and Cmcm Li12O3SeClBr3 (E (d) = 0.097 eV/atom, L (s) > 0.5, E (g) = 3.36 eV, E (h) = -86.88 kJ/mol, and ? = 7.8 x 10(-1) S/cm). Possible solid-state synthesis routes for the screened SE candidates were also explored using thermodynamic phase competition analysis and classical nucleation theory reaction barrier. Aside from providing a well-informed list of potentially novel ip-type SEs, our work also reports on an effective calculation methodology for tiered large-scale material screening which, at the same time, incorporates "small data" learning on target property datasets that are computationally expensive to obtain. The generated datasets are expected as well to be of great utility for future data-driven material design efforts.

ID USAGE PATTERNS
AB Although shared e-scooters have displayed both complementary and competitive relationships with public transport, less attention has been paid to investigating the spatiotemporal variations of such relationships, and how the relationships are associated with the urban built environment. To bridge the gaps, we first explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of such relationships by conducting a comparative study of Stockholm and Helsinki based on the empirical data. Then, an explainable AI method is applied to examine the associations between the relationships and built environment. We found that Helsinki presents higher ratios of the competitive dominant areas (DPET) compared with Stockholm showing higher ratios of the complementary dominant areas (DPLE). The correlation analysis results indicate that the distance-to-public-transport is associated with DPET in two cities. Some factors present a non-linear effect, e.g., the density-of-the population, etc. This study is beneficial for the better integration of shared e-scooters and public transport towards sustainable urban mobility systems.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to transform medical imaging by leveraging the vast data contained in medical images. Deep learning and radiomics are the two main AI methods currently being applied within radiology. Deep learning uses a layered set of self-correcting algorithms to develop a mathematical model that best fits the data. Radiomics converts imaging data into mineable features such as signal intensity, shape, texture, and higher-order features. Both methods have the potential to improve disease detection, characterization, and prognostication. This article reviews the current status of artificial intelligence in pancreatic imaging and critically appraises the quality of existing evidence using the radiomics quality score. & COPY; 2023 Societe francaise de radiologie.

AB Background: Among the 382 million diabetic patients worldwide, approximately 30% experience neuropathy, and one-fifth of these patients eventually develop diabetes cognitive impairment (CI). However, the mechanism underlying diabetes CI remains unknown, and early diagnostic methods or effective treatments are currently not available.Objective: This study aimed to explore the risk factors for CI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), screen potential therapeutic drugs for T2DM-CI, and provide evidence for preventing and treating T2DM-CI.Methods: This study focused on the T2DM population admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan University of Chinese Medicine. Sociodemographic data and clinical objective indicators of T2DM patients admitted from January 2018 to December 2022 were collected. Based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Scale scores, 719 patients were categorized into two groups, the T2DM-CI group with CI and the T2DM-N group with normal cognition. The survey content included demographic characteristics, laboratory serological indicators, complications, and medication information. Six machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the risk factors of T2DM-CI, and the Shapley method was used to enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we developed a graph neural network (GNN) model to identify potential drugs associated with T2DM-CI.Results: Our results showed that the T2DM-CI risk prediction model based on Catboost exhibited superior performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 (specificity of 93.17% and sensitivity of 78.58%). Diabetes duration, age, education level, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), drinking, and intestinal flora were identified as risk factors for T2DM-CI. The top 10 potential drugs related to T2DM-CI, including Metformin, Liraglutide, and Lixisenatide, were selected by the GNN model. Some herbs, such as licorice and cuscutae semen, were also included. Finally, we discovered the mechanism of herbal medicine interventions in gut microbiota.Conclusion: The method based on Interpreting AI and GNN can identify the risk factors and potential drugs associated with T2DM-CI.

AB In its recent form, Artificial intelligence (AI) is an ensemble of technologies, which can be defined as machinebased systems for effective enterprise automation and influential decisions". If businesses that use AI can potentially reap a competitive advantage, the optimal exploitation of such a complex ensemble of technologies remains uncertain as well as requires to have competitive access to complements such as data or new skills. Existing models of organizational use of technologies often ignore either the dynamics of competitive interactions (which can lead to pre-emption or epidemic diffusion) or the role of uncertainty, or both. In the case of AI, one type of uncertainty is particularly important: uncertainty about the technology's use cases (i.e., what to do with it). This paper proposes to apply a real options perspective to the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) adoption framework in order to uncover important patterns in the use of AI among firms. The results are threefold: (1) we find evidence of significant epidemic effects in AI use, (2) uncertainty moderates epidemic effects, and (3) the impact of uncertainty depends on its source: an uncertain AI use case reduces herd behaviours while uncertainty about use case returns still favours them. These results highlight the importance of exploration and collective learning in the diffusion of emerging and complex technologies, especially when companies struggle to identify the most profitable use cases for the technology.

ID MODELING STEEL CORROSION; REINFORCEMENT CORROSION; COVER-CRACKING;

AB The present study concerns the finite element modelling of structural behaviour for concrete structure subjected to the axial load and simultaneously corrosion of steel embedment. The structural capacity was expressed into the risk of cracking with respect to the compressive and tensile stress, while a development of steel corrosion was reflected by the increasing rust formation on the steel surface. To consider the buffering capacity at the steel -concrete interface against stress generated by the rust formation, the interfacial gap was taken, of which the width accounted for 10 & mu;m. As a result, it was found that the tensile deformation could occur with only the axial load, which can be further developed by the rust formation. Also, the compressive deformation took place at the steel-concrete interface, arising from the steel corrosion, which had been marginally affected by the axial load. At the steel-concrete interface, the risk of cracking was strongly dependent on the position, due to the offset effect of stress. Moreover, the compressive strength of concrete had a crucial impact on the risk of cracking, in particular, the compressive cracking could be adversely mitigated by the lower strength of concrete.

AB Background The rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) holds great potential for plastic surgeons. ChatGPT, a recently released AI large language model (LLM), promises applications across many disciplines, including healthcare.Objectives The aim of this article was to provide a primer for plastic surgeons on AI, LLM, and ChatGPT, including an analysis of current demonstrated and proposed clinical applications.Methods A systematic review was performed identifying medical and surgical literature on ChatGPT's proposed clinical applications. Variables assessed included applications investigated, command tasks provided, user input information, AI-emulated human skills, output validation, and reported limitations.Results The analysis included 175 articles reporting on 13 plastic surgery applications and 116 additional clinical applications, categorized by field and purpose. Thirty-four applications within plastic surgery are thus proposed, with relevance to different target audiences, including attending plastic surgeons (n = 17, 50%), trainees/educators (n = 8, 24.0%), researchers/scholars (n = 7, 21%), and patients (n = 2, 6%). The 15 identified limitations of ChatGPT were categorized by training data, algorithm, and ethical considerations.Conclusions Widespread use of ChatGPT in plastic surgery will depend on rigorous research of proposed applications to validate performance and address limitations. This systemic review aims to guide research, development, and regulation to safely adopt AI in plastic surgery.

AB Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underestimation of prostate cancer extent complicates the definition of focal treatment margins.
   Objective: To validate focal treatment margins produced by an artificial intelligence (AI) model.
   Design, setting, and participants: Testing was conducted retrospectively in an independent dataset of 50 consecutive patients who had radical prostatectomy for intermediate-risk cancer. An AI deep learning model incorporated multimodal imaging and biopsy data to produce three-dimensional cancer estimation maps and margins. AI margins were compared with conventional MRI regions of interest (ROIs), 10-mm margins around ROIs, and hemigland margins. The AI model also furnished predictions of negative surgical margin probability, which were assessed for accuracy.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Comparing AI with conventional margins, sensitivity was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative margin rates using chi-square tests. Predicted versus observed negative margin probability was assessed using linear regression. Clinically significant prostate cancer (International Society of Urological Pathology grade >= 2) delineated on whole-mount histopathology served as ground truth.
   Results and limitations: The mean sensitivity for cancer-bearing voxels was higher for AI margins (97%) than for conventional ROIs (37%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (93%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (94%, p < 0.001). For index lesions, AI margins were more often negative (90%) than conventional ROIs (0%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (82%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (66%, p = 0.004). Predicted and observed negative margin probabilities were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.98, median error = 4%). Limitations include a validation dataset derived from a single institution's prostatectomy population.
   Conclusions: The AI model was accurate and effective in an independent test set. This approach could improve and standardize treatment margin definition, potentially reducing cancer recurrence rates. Furthermore, an accurate assessment of negative margin probability could facilitate informed decision-making for patients and physicians.
   Patient summary: Artificial intelligence was used to predict the extent of tumors in surgically removed prostate specimens. It predicted tumor margins more accurately than conventional methods. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the effect of plasma treatment versus conventional treatment on the micro shear bond strength (mu SBS), surface roughness, and wettability of three different CAD/CAM materials.
   Materials and methods: Sixty cylindrical specimens (5 mm diameter x 3 mm height) were prepared from three different CAD/CAM materials: Group A: Zirconia, Group B: Lithium disilicate, and Group C: Resin nano-ceramic. Each group was subdivided into two subgroups according to surface treatment used: Subgroup I: Conventional treatment, zirconia was sandblasted with Al2O3, while lithium disilicate and resin nano-ceramic were etched with hydrofluoric acid. Subgroup II: Plasma treatment, the surface of each material was treated with a plasma device (PiezoBrush (R) PZ3 Handheld Device, Relyon Plasma, Regensburg, Germany). G-Multi PRIMER was applied, then self-adhesive cement (G-CEM ONE) was applied using a split mold (1 mm diameter x 3 mm height), and mu SBS was tested in a universal testing machine. The surface roughness was measured using a profilometer. Nine additional specimens of each material for wettability test using an optical tensiometer.
   Statistical analysis: The data were analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni test at a level of significance of 0.05.
   Results: The highest mean of mu SBS was recorded by AII (27.3 MPa), while the lowest was recorded by AI (17.9 MPa). One-way ANOVA test revealed a significant difference among groups. Bonferroni test showed each two subgroups significant difference except subgroups AI, CI and BII, CII, where there was a non-significant difference. For all CAD/CAM materials, conventional treatment increased the surface roughness compared to plasma treatment, while the contact angle decreased after plasma treatment.
   Conclusion: Plasma treatment increased the mu SBS of resin cement to zirconia significantly while not significantly affecting the mu SBS of resin nano-ceramic. Conventional treatment of lithium disilicate provided significantly higher mu SBS than plasma treatment.

AB Miniaturized electrical stimulation (ES) implants show great promise in practice, but their real-time control by means of biophysical mechanistic algorithms is not feasible due to computational complexity. Here, we study the feasibility of more computationally efficient machine learning methods to control ES implants. For this, we estimate the normalized twitch force of the stimulated extensor digitorum longus muscle on n = 11 Wistar rats with intra- and cross-subject calibration. After 2000 training stimulations, we reach a mean absolute error of 0.03 in an intra-subject setting and 0.2 in a cross-subject setting with a random forest regressor. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first experiment showing the feasibility of AI to simulate complex ES mechanistic models. However, the results of cross-subject training motivate more research on error reduction methods for this setting.

AB Bacterial intercellular signaling mediated by small molecules, also called autoinducers (AIs), enables synchronized behavior in response to environmental conditions, and in many bacterial pathogens, intercellular signaling controls virulence gene expression. However, in the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), although three signals, named AI-1, AI-2 and AI-3, have been described, their roles in virulence remain elusive. AI-3 is the 3,6- isomer of a previously described Vibrio cholerae signaling molecule; 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (3,5-DPO). To elucidate the role of AI-3/DPO in S. Typhimurium, we have mapped the global transcriptomic responses to 3,5- and 3,6-DPO isomers in S. Typhimurium. Our studies showed that DPO affects expression of almost 8% of all genes. Specifically, expression of several genes involved in gut-colonization respond to DPO. Interestingly, most of the affected genes are similarly regulated by 3,5-DPO and 3,6-DPO, respectively, indicating that the two isomers have overlapping roles in S. Typhimurium.

TI Development of a tongue image-based machine learning tool for the
   diagnosis of gastric cancer: a prospective multicentre clinical cohort
   study

DT Article

   Chinese medicine; Tongue coating microbiome
AB Background Tongue images (the colour, size and shape of the tongue and the colour, thickness and moisture content of the tongue coating), reflecting the health state of the whole body according to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), have been widely used in China for thousands of years. Herein, we investigated the value of tongue images and the tongue coating microbiome in the diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC).
   Methods From May 2020 to January 2021, we simultaneously collected tongue images and tongue coating samples from 328 patients with GC (all newly diagnosed with GC) and 304 non-gastric cancer (NGC) participants in China, and 16 S rDNA was used to characterize the microbiome of the tongue coating samples. Then, artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning models were established to evaluate the value of tongue images and the tongue coating microbiome in the diagnosis of GC. Considering that tongue imaging is more convenient and economical as a diagnostic tool, we further conducted a prospective multicentre clinical study from May 2020 to March 2022 in China and recruited 937 patients with GC and 1911 participants with NGC from 10 centres across China to further evaluate the role of tongue images in the diagnosis of GC. Moreover, we verified this approach in another independent external validation cohort that included 294 patients with GC and 521 participants with NGC from 7 centres. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01090362.
   Findings For the first time, we found that both tongue images and the tongue coating microbiome can be used as tools for the diagnosis of GC, and the area under the curve (AUC) value of the tongue image-based diagnostic model was 0.89. The AUC values of the tongue coating microbiome-based model reached 0.94 using genus data and 0.95 using species data. The results of the prospective multicentre clinical study showed that the AUC values of the three tongue image-based models for GCs reached 0.88-0.92 in the internal verification and 0.83-0.88 in the independent external verification, which were significantly superior to the combination of eight blood biomarkers.
   Interpretation Our results suggest that tongue images can be used as a stable method for GC diagnosis and are significantly superior to conventional blood biomarkers. The three kinds of tongue image-based AI deep learning diagnostic models that we developed can be used to adequately distinguish patients with GC from participants with NGC, even early GC and precancerous lesions, such as atrophic gastritis (AG).

AB Recent spectacular progress in computational technologies has led to an unprecedented boom in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is now used in a plethora of research areas and has demonstrated its capability to bring new approaches and solutions to various research problems. However, the extensive computation required to train AI algorithms comes with a cost. Driven by the need to reduce the energy consumption, the carbon footprint and the cost of computers running machine learning algorithms, TinyML is nowadays considered as a promising AI alternative focusing on technologies and applications for extremely low-profile devices. This paper presents the results of a literature survey of all TinyML applications and related research efforts. Our survey builds a taxonomy of TinyML techniques that have been used so far to bring new solutions to various domains, such as healthcare, smart farming, environment, and anomaly detection. Finally, this survey highlights the remaining challenges and points out possible future research directions. We anticipate that this survey will motivate further discussions on the various fields of applications of TinyML and the synergy of resource-constrained devices and edge intelligence.

AB Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil in a particular area to provide favorable chemical, physical and biological characteristics that help the plant in its growth. It is affected by multiple parameters, from the available concentration of Nitrogen in the soil to the concentration of Organic Carbon in the soil. This paper discusses the implementation of an explainable AI (XAI) model based on a Random Forest classifier. The developed model reliably predicts the relative soil fertility of a given soil using its various physiochemical properties, and explain the reasons behind the model's soil fertility indicator prediction using user friendly graphs. The model shows 97.02% accuracy in comparison with state-of-the-art machine learning models. The paper also discusses applications of developed model in providing possible solutions to further improve upon soil fertility in the short term and long term.

AB Background: Avian influenza (AI) virus detections occurred frequently in 2022 and continue to pose a health, economic, and food security risk. The most recent global analysis of official reports of animal outbreaks and human infections with all reportable AI viruses was published almost a decade ago. Increased or renewed reports of AI viruses, especially high pathogenicity H5N8 and H5N1 in birds and H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 in humans globally, have established the need for a comprehensive review of current global AI virus surveillance data to assess the pandemic risk of AI viruses.Objective: This study aims to provide an analysis of global AI animal outbreak and human case surveillance information from the last decade by describing the circulating virus subtypes, regions and temporal trends in reporting, and country characteristics associated with AI virus outbreak reporting in animals; surveillance and reporting gaps for animals and humans are identified. Methods: We analyzed AI virus infection reports among animals and humans submitted to animal and public health authorities from January 2013 to June 2022 and compared them with reports from January 2005 to December 2012. A multivariable regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between variables of interest and reported AI virus animal outbreaks.Results: From 2013 to 2022, 52.2% (95/182) of World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) Member Countries identified 34 AI virus subtypes during 21,249 outbreaks. The most frequently reported subtypes were high pathogenicity AI H5N1 (10,079/21,249, 47.43%) and H5N8 (6722/21,249, 31.63%). A total of 10 high pathogenicity AI and 6 low pathogenicity AI virus subtypes were reported to the WOAH for the first time during 2013-2022. AI outbreaks in animals occurred in 26 more Member Countries than reported in the previous 8 years. Decreasing World Bank income classification was significantly associated with decreases in reported AI outbreaks (P<.001-.02). Between January 2013 and June 2022, 17/194 (8.8%) World Health Organization (WHO) Member States reported 2000 human AI virus infections of 10 virus subtypes. H7N9 (1568/2000, 78.40%) and H5N1 (254/2000, 12.70%) viruses accounted for the most human infections. As many as 8 of these 17 Member States did not report a human case prior to 2013. Of 1953 human cases with available information, 74.81% (n=1461) had a known animal exposure before onset of illness. The median time from illness onset to the notification posted on the WHO event information site was 15 days (IQR 9-30 days; mean 24 days). Seasonality patterns of animal outbreaks and human infections with AI viruses were very similar, occurred year-round, and peaked during November through May.Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that AI outbreaks are more frequently reported and geographically widespread than in the past. Global surveillance gaps include inconsistent reporting from all regions and human infection reporting delays. Continued monitoring for AI virus outbreaks in animals and human infections with AI viruses is crucial for pandemic preparedness.

AB This paper uses two optimizers (Improved Gray Wolf Optimizer (I_GWO) and Dragonfly Optimization Algorithm (DA)) for the sensitivity and robustness of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely radial basis functions (RBFs). The purpose is to evaluate and analyze the predictive strength of high-performance concrete (HPC). 170 samples were collected for this purpose. This includes eight input parameters, cement, silica fume, fly ash, water, coarse aggregate, total aggregate, high water reducing agent, concrete age, and one output parameter, the compressive strength, to produce Increase learning and validation data sets. The proposed AI model was validated against several standard criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), scatter index (SI), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), and coefficient of persistence (CP), n10_index. Many runs were performed to analyze the sensitivity and robustness of the model. The results show that I_GWO using RBF performs better than DA. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis indicated that cement content and HPC test age are the most essential and sensitive factors for predicting the compressive strength of HPC, according to the evaluations performed on the models, it was seen that the IGWO RBF model provided better results compared to other models and can be introduced as the practical model for the prediction of HPC's CS. In conclusion, this study can help to select appropriate AI models and suitable input parameters to accurately and quickly estimate the compressive strength of HPC.

AB Accurate nodule labeling and interpretable machine learning are important for lung cancer diagnosis. To circumvent the label ambiguity issue of commonly-used unsure nodule data such as LIDC-IDRI, we constructed a sure nodule data with gold-standard clinical diagnosis. To make the traditional CNN networks interpretable, we propose herewith a novel collaborative model to improve the trustworthiness of lung cancer predictions by self-regulation, which endows the model with the ability to provide explanations in meaningful terms to a human-observer. The proposed collaborative model transfers domain knowledge from unsure data to sure data and encodes a cause-and-effect logic based on nodule segmentation and attributes. Further, we construct a regularization strategy that treats the visual saliency maps (Grad-CAM) not only as post-hoc model interpretation, but also as a rational measure for trustworthy learning in such a way that the CNN features are extracted mainly from intrinsic nodule features. Moreover, similar nodule retrieval makes a nodule diagnosis system more understandable and credible to humans-observers based on the nodule attributes. We demonstrate that the combination of the collaborative model and regularization strategy can provide the best performances on lung cancer prediction and interpretable diagnosis that can automatically: 1) classify the nodule patches; 2) analyse and explain a prediction by nodule segmentation and attributes; and 3) retrieve similar nodules for comparison and diagnosis.

AB In this study, an artificial intelligence based real-time prediction and control model to optimize condenser water temperature and discharge air temperature (DAT) set-points in water-cooled air handling unit (AHU) system has been developed. EnergyPlus-MATLAB co-simulation has been conducted to analyze the developed model's effectiveness. To develop artificial neural networks (ANN) model, embedded neural network objects in MATLAB was utilized. The developed model could decide an optimal temperature set-points based on outdoor air wet-bulb temperature to reflect the Korean climate context. As a result, the developed ANN prediction model showed the predictive performance of Cv(RMSE) of approximately 21%. Compared to the conventional fixed temperature algorithm, which fixes AHU DAT at 14 & DEG;C and condenser water temperature at 32 & DEG;C, the ANN based optimized control showed a 22% total cooling energy reduction. These results show that significant energy savings can be achieved by simultaneously controlling condenser water temperature and AHU DAT set-points considering Korean climatic characteristics using AI technologies such as ANN models.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to develop preprocedural real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems for predicting individualized risks of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) and dialysis requirement within 30 days following contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT).Method: This single-center, retrospective study analyzed adult patients from emergency or in-patient departments who underwent CECT; 18,895 patients were included after excluding those who were already on dialysis, had stage V chronic kidney disease, or had missing data regarding serum creatinine levels within 7 days before and after CECT. Clinical parameters, laboratory data, medication exposure, and comorbid diseases were selected as predictive features. The patients were randomly divided into model training and testing groups at a 7:3 ratio. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were employed to create prediction models, which were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.Results: The incidence rates of CA-AKI and dialysis within 30 days post-CECT were 6.69% and 0.98%, respectively. For CA-AKI prediction, LR and RF exhibited similar performance, with areas under curve (AUCs) of 0.769 and 0.757, respectively. For 30-day dialysis prediction, LR (AUC, 0.863) and RF (AUC, 0.872) also exhibited similar performance. Relative to eGFR-alone, the LR and RF models produced significantly higher AUCs for CAAKI prediction (LR vs. eGFR alone, 0.769 vs. 0.626, p < 0.001) and 30-day dialysis prediction (RF vs. eGFR alone, 0.872 vs. 0.738, p < 0.001).Conclusions: The proposed AI prediction models significantly outperformed eGFR-alone for predicting the CA-AKI and 30-day dialysis risks of emergency department and hospitalized patients who underwent CECT.

AB Objectives: This research focuses on performing teeth segmentation with panoramic radiograph images using a denoised encoder-based residual U-Net model, which enhances segmentation techniques and has the capacity to adapt to predictions with different and new data in the dataset, making the proposed model more robust and assisting in the accurate identification of damages in individual teeth.Methods: The effective segmentation starts with pre-processing the Tufts dataset to resize images to avoid computational complexities. Subsequently, the prediction of the defect in teeth is performed with the denoised encoder block in the residual U-Net model, in which a modified identity block is provided in the encoder section for finer segmentation on specific regions in images, and features are identified optimally. The denoised block aids in handling noisy ground truth images effectively.Results: Proposed module achieved greater values of mean dice and mean IoU with 98.90075 and 98.74147Conclusions: Proposed AI enabled model permitted a precise approach to segment the teeth on Tuffs dental dataset in spite of the existence of densed dental filling and the kind of tooth. Clinical Significance: The proposed model is pivotal for improved dental diagnostics, offering precise identification of dental anomalies. This could revolutionize clinical dental settings by facilitating more accurate treatments and safer examination processes with lower radiation exposure, thus enhancing overall patient care.

ID ACCIDENT DIAGNOSIS
AB The application of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in nuclear power plants has the potential to facilitate significant advancements in the industry. However, nuclear system engineers and regulators have expressed concerns regarding the reliability of AI components owing to a lack of documentation and appropriate verification methods that differ from those used for traditional software. Accordingly, this study proposes a systematic approach for the verification and validation of AI components based on nuclear software regulatory guidelines. The proposed strategy includes process verification and functional testing activities specifically tailored to AI components for instrumentation and control systems. This approach serves as a foundation for fostering understanding and agreement among system engineers, operating licensees, and regulatory bodies on the use of AI components in nuclear power plants.

AB For many multiplayer games, including massively multiplayer online role-playing games, consumer skill sets with the game play an important role in engagement. Despite their importance, many aspects of consumers' skill sets are still less well understood. This research considers the formation and evolution of players' skill sets from two perspectives: (1) learning-by-doing, in which a consumer gradually improves his or her skill set with the game from past experiences with other players, and (2) learning about matched players' skill sets from their observed characteristics (i.e., learning-about-others). Using policy simulations, we further demonstrate how inferences of players' latent skill sets could help game developers design strategies for better engagement, from the perspectives of version upgrades, targeted user visibility, and artificial intelligence-powered bots.

AB This paper proposes a Reconfigurable In-Memory Advance Computing architecture using a novel 10 SRAM cell. In addition to basic logic operations, the proposed R-InMAC can also implement complex Boolean computing operations such as binary addition/subtraction, binary-to-gray, gray-to-binary conversion, 2's complement, less/greater than, and increment/decrement. Furthermore, content addressable memory (CAM) operation to search a binary string in a memory array is also proposed efficiently. It can search true and complementary data strings in a single cycle. The proposed R-InMAC architecture's reconfigurability allows it to be configured according to the needed operation and bit precision, making it ideal and energy-efficient. In addition, compared to the standard SRAM cells, the proposed 10T cell is suited for implementing the XNOR-based binary convolution operation required in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) with improved latency of 58.89%. The optimized full adder of the proposed R-InMAC shows decrement in the area by 40%, static power by 28%, dynamic power by 55.2%, and latency by 25.3% as compared to conventional designs, making this work a promising candidate for modern edge AI compute in-memory systems.

AB Unlike many previous studies that often focus on optimizing energy efficiency for buildings when detailed design drawings are available, this paper introduces a newly integrated model for energy-efficient building envelope design in the early stages (when detailed design drawings are not yet available). The newly developed model includes three main components: a simulation model, a predictive model, and an optimization model. The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption. The optimization model which uses AI optimization algorithms (such as NSGA II, DSE, and MOPSO) integrates the machine learning predictive model into the evaluation function during the evolutionary process, efficiently searching for Pareto-optimal building envelope solutions. Results show simultaneous savings in cost and energy, with savings of 7.52 % in cost and 8.48 % in energy, or 21.17 % in cost and 0.4 % in energy, for a case study in Vietnam. This model establishes a foundation by providing design solutions for stakeholders to assess, and can incorporate additional objectives at later stages.

AB This paper explores the potential impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) on developing countries, considering both positive and negative effects across various domains of information, culture, and industry. Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that generate content, such as text, audio, or video, aiming to produce novel and creative outputs based on training data. Compared to conversational artificial intelligence, generative artificial intelligence systems have the unique capability of not only providing replies but also generating the content of those responses. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, exemplified by tools like ChatGPT, have gained popularity and reshaped content production and creation. However, the benefits of generative artificial intelligence are not equally accessible to all, especially in developing countries, where limited access to cutting-edge technologies and inadequate infrastructure pose challenges. This paper seeks to understand the potential impact of generative AI technologies on developing countries, considering economic growth, access to technology, and the potential paradigm shift in education, healthcare, and the environment. The findings emphasize the importance of providing the necessary support and infrastructure to ensure that generative AI contributes to inclusive development rather than deepening existing inequalities. The study highlights the significance of integrating Generative AI into the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in developing countries, where technological change is a crucial determinant of progress and equitable growth.

AB Pollen and tracheophyte spores are ubiquitous environmental indicators at local and global scales. Palynology is typically performed manually by microscopic analysis; a specialised and time-consuming task limited in taxonomical precision and sampling frequency, therefore restricting data quality used to inform climate change and pollen forecasting models. We build on the growing work using AI (artificial intelligence) for automated pollen classification to design a flexible network that can deal with the uncertainty of broad-scale environmental applications. We combined imaging flow cytometry with Guided Deep Learning to identify and accurately categorise pollen in environmental samples; here, pollen grains captured within c. 5500 Cal yr BP old lake sediments. Our network discriminates not only pollen included in training libraries to the species level but, depending on the sample, can classify previously unseen pollen to the likely phylogenetic order, family and even genus. Our approach offers valuable insights into the development of a widely transferable, rapid and accurate exploratory tool for pollen classification in 'real-world' environmental samples with improved accuracy over pure deep learning techniques. This work has the potential to revolutionise many aspects of palynology, allowing a more detailed spatial and temporal understanding of pollen in the environment with improved taxonomical resolution.

AB The brain is the perfect place to look for inspiration to develop more efficient neural networks. The inner workings of our synapses and neurons provide a glimpse at what the future of deep learning might look like. This article serves as a tutorial and perspective showing how to apply the lessons learned from several decades of research in deep learning, gradient descent, backpropagation, and neuroscience to biologically plausible spiking neural networks (SNNs). We also explore the delicate interplay between encoding data as spikes and the learning process; the challenges and solutions of applying gradient-based learning to SNNs; the subtle link between temporal backpropagation and spike timing-dependent plasticity; and how deep learning might move toward biologically plausible online learning. Some ideas are well accepted and commonly used among the neuromorphic engineering community, while others are presented or justified for the first time here. A series of companion interactive tutorials complementary to this article using our Python package, snnTorch, are also made available: https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html.

TI Aci-bench: a Novel Ambient Clinical Intelligence Dataset for

LA English
DT Article
AB Recent immense breakthroughs in generative models such as in GPT4 have precipitated re-imagined ubiquitous usage of these models in all applications. One area that can benefit by improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) is healthcare. The note generation task from doctor-patient encounters, and its associated electronic medical record documentation, is one of the most arduous time-consuming tasks for physicians. It is also a natural prime potential beneficiary to advances in generative models. However with such advances, benchmarking is more critical than ever. Whether studying model weaknesses or developing new evaluation metrics, shared open datasets are an imperative part of understanding the current state-of-the-art. Unfortunately as clinic encounter conversations are not routinely recorded and are difficult to ethically share due to patient confidentiality, there are no sufficiently large clinic dialogue-note datasets to benchmark this task. Here we present the Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark (aci-bench) corpus, the largest dataset to date tackling the problem of AI-assisted note generation from visit dialogue. We also present the benchmark performances of several common state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and becomes a global pandemic in a few months. Due to this, many of the country has taken harsh measures such as a complete lockdown, which has severely affected the country's economic growth. Thus, predicting the 4th wave of Covid 19 cases in India and knowing the forecast on the Covid19 cases like confirmed cases, death cases and recovered Cases helps the country to pre-planned the measures to be taken. Mathematical modelling and trending AI algorithms can analyze data to trace the spread of diseases or predict future trends, enabling proactive measures and resource allocation. For analyzing the fourth wave Covid19 the SEIRS epidemic model analyze the ideation of epidemics flow and deep neural network model, i.e., optimized LSTM model supports the ideation with trained on the pre-processed featured datasets and predicting or forecasting the confirmed cases, recovered cases and death cases due to Covid19. The model has been trained and tested on real datasets from genuine government sites. The model produces the RSME as 967.94 and R-squared as 0.6. The model also has forecasted confirmed cases from Jan to April 2022 in India, which is very close to the real datasets. Cross-validation has been applied to ensure the performance of the optimized model.

AB Background: Extremities fractures are a leading cause of death and disability, especially in the elderly. Avulsion fracture are also the most commonly missed diagnosis, and delayed diagnosis leads to higher litigation rates. Therefore, this study evaluates the diagnostic efficiency of the artificial intelligence (AI) model before and after optimization based on computed tomography (CT) images and then compares it with that of radiologists, especially for avulsion fractures.Methods: The digital X-ray photography [digital radiography (DR)] and CT images of adult limb trauma in our hospital from 2017 to 2020 were retrospectively collected, with or without 1 or more fractures of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee, ankle, and foot. Labeling of the fracture referred to the visualization of the fracture on the corresponding CT images. After training the pre-optimized AI model, the diagnostic performance of the pre-optimized AI, optimized AI model, and the initial radiological reports were evaluated. For the lesion level, the detection rate of avulsion and non-avulsion fractures was analyzed, whereas for the case level, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were compared among them.Results: The total datasets (1,035 cases) were divided into a training set (n=675), a validation set (n=169), and a test set (n=191) in a balanced joint distribution. At the lesion level, the detection rates of avulsion fracture (57.89% vs. 35.09%, P=0.004) and non-avulsion fracture (85.64% vs. 71.29%, P<0.001) by the optimized AI were significantly higher than that by pre-optimized AI. The average precision (AP) of the optimized AI model for all lesions was higher than that of pre-optimized AI model (0.582 vs. 0.425). The detection rate of avulsion fracture by the optimized AI model was significantly higher than that by radiologists (57.89% vs. 29.82%, P=0.002). For the non-avulsion fracture, there was no significant difference of detection rate between the optimized AI model and radiologists (P=0.853). At the case level, the accuracy (86.40% vs. 71.93%, P<0.001) and sensitivity (87.29% vs. 73.48%, P<0.001) of the optimized AI were significantly higher than those of the pre-optimized AI model. There was no statistical difference in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity between the optimized AI model and the radiologists (P>0.05).Conclusions: The optimized AI model improves the diagnostic efficacy in detecting extremity fractures on radiographs, and the optimized AI model is significantly better than radiologists in detecting avulsion fractures, which may be helpful in the clinical practice of orthopedic emergency.

ID SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY; DESIGN; BIOSENSORS; SYSTEMS; TOOLS
AB Dynamic pathway engineering aims to build metabolic production systems embedded with intracellular control mechanisms for improved performance. These control systems enable host cells to self-regulate the temporal activity of a production pathway in response to perturbations, using a combination of biosensors and feedback circuits for controlling expression of heterologous enzymes. Pathway design, however, requires assembling together multiple biological parts into suitable circuit architectures, as well as careful calibration of the function of each component. This results in a large design space that is costly to navigate through experimentation alone. Methods from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are gaining increasing attention as tools to accelerate the design cycle, owing to their ability to identify hidden patterns in data and rapidly screen through large collections of designs. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the application of machine learning methods to the design of dynamic pathways and their components. We cover recent successes and offer perspectives for future developments in the field. The integration of AI into metabolic engineering pipelines offers great opportunities to streamline design and discover control systems for improved production of high-value chemicals.

Lactating primiparous Holstein cows from 6 commercial farms were stratified into high, medium, and low fertility groups based on a reproduction index value calculated from multiple genomically enhanced predicted transmitting abilities to predict the number of days to achieve pregnancy. Within herd and fertility group, cows were randomly assigned either to a program that prioritized AIE (P-AIE; n = 1,416) and used TAI for cows not AIE for all AI services or another that prioritized TAI and had an extended voluntary waiting period for first service and prioritized TAI for second and greater AI services (P-TAI; n = 1,338). Cash flow (CF) per cow accumulated for the experimental (first) and second calving interval (CIN) and cash flow per slot per 28 mo after calving in the experimental lactation were calculated. Market and rearing heifer cost values were used for estimating CF. For cows in the high fertility group, a positive effect of delayed pregnancy on milk income during the first lactation was observed (+$248 for P-TAI) but was insufficient to generate significant differences in CF be-tween treatments mainly because of milk income compensation in the second lactation (+$125 for P-AIE) and minor reductions in reproductive cost and gains in calf value for the P-AIE treatment. In this regard, CF for 2 CIN was greater for the P-TAI treatment by $61 and $86 for market and rearing replacement heifer cost, respectively. Similarly, CF per slot was favorable to the P-TAI treatment but only by $13 and $47 for market and rearing replacement heifer cost, respectively. For cows in the low fertility group, CF was numerically in favor of the P-AIE treatment due to a pregnancy and herd exit dynamics that resulted in gains in milk income over feed cost during the first ($29) and second ($113) lactation. Differences in CF for the 2 CIN were $58 and $47 for market or rearing heifer value, respectively, and $77 and $19 for market and rearing heifer values, respectively for the slot analysis. Differences in CF between cows of different genetic merit for fertility were consistent across treatment and estimation method. Of note, cows in the low fertility group had greater CF than cows in the high fertility group in all comparisons, ranging from $198 per cow for 2 CIN to as much as $427 per slot. For the low fertility group, greater milk production contributed directly (milk in-come over feed cost) and indirectly (reduced culling) to increased CF. We concluded that genetic merit for fertility and CF are associated because cows of inferior genetic potential for fertility had greater CF than cows of superior genetic for fertility despite some increased costs and reduced revenues. Also, the magnitude of the CF differences observed for cows of different genetic merit for fertility managed with the P-AIE or P-TAI program may be valuable to commercial dairy farms but did not allow to conclusively support the choice of a type of reproductive management strategy for cows of different genetic merit for fertility.

AB The irrelevant and repeated features in high-dimensional datasets can negatively affect the final performance and accuracy of classification-based models. Therefore, feature selection (FS) techniques can be used to determine the most optimal relevant features. In this paper, we fuse a new enhanced model from Lemurs Optimization (LO) algorithm, called Enhanced Lemurs Optimization (ELO). We combine Opposition Based Learning (OBL) and Local Search Algorithm (LSA) to address exploration and exploitation challenges, respectively. Our proposed ELO algorithm incorporates U-shaped and Sigmoid transfer functions during the position update step, leading to improved accuracy and convergence. These new deployments based on the U-shaped and Sigmoid transfer functions are called ELO-U and ELO-S algorithms, respectively. The performance of all three new versions of our proposed optimization algorithms (ELO, ELO-U, and ELO-S) has been evaluated using 21 UCI datasets in different fields and sizes. Moreover, their results are also compared to other competitive algorithms. The evaluation process included several measurements such as fitness value, an average of selected features, and average accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ELO-U algorithm achieves the best average accuracy of 91.03%. Statistical analysis using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests confirms the superiority of ELO-U over other competitors.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB The use of nanoscale arch structures in vibration detection has become popular due to their ability to capture resonance in two independent directions. This study investigates the vibration behavior of a small-scale cantilever curved beam structure made of a functionally graded carbon nanotube reinforced nanocomposite core and piezoelectric surface layers on a viscoelastic substrate. The piezoelectric layers convert motion into electrical signals, allowing for the harvesting of high-frequency motions in a delicate manner. Various theories, including the first-order shear deformation theory, strain gradient theory, and nonlocal theory, are used to capture the mechanical properties of the FG nanocomposite core at both nano- and micro-scales. The equations of motion and natural boundary conditions are derived using Hamilton's principle and solved using Akbari-Ganji's method. An artificial intelligence method is also presented to simplify the solution procedure and calculate numerical results based on important parameters in the vibrational behavior analysis. The study demonstrates the significance of viscoelastic properties of the substrate and the volume fraction of CNT in composite core in the frequency analysis of the arch structure, as shown by the results of both the numerical and AI methods.

AB Our paper formalizes a production function to give microeconomic foundations for the adoption of Generative AI (GAI) within workplaces. The production function accounts for task-interdependencies, the worker-GAI interaction and indistinguishability between human-created and AI-generated outputs. We show that workers and GAI represent two distinct but interdependent sides of the production, that jointly generate a network externality in learning that drives productivity. We find that in open learning organizations favoring the worker-GAI interaction, GAI should be matched to workers based on their ability to detect errors. We analyze configurations where the worker-GAI interaction is limited, referred as closed learning organizations, including firms banning the use of GAI, technological superclusters and emergence of small entrepreneurs innovating with GAI.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Hepatic macrophages represent a key cellular component of the liver and are essential for the progression of acute liver failure (ALF). We construct artificial apoptotic cells loaded with itaconic acid (AI-Cells), wherein the compositions of the synthetic plasma membrane and surface topology are rationally engineered. AI-Cells are predominantly localized to the liver and further transport to hepatic macrophages. Intravenous administra-tion of AI-Cells modulates macrophage inflammation to protect the liver from acetaminophen-induced ALF. Mechanistically, AI-Cells act on caspase-1 to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated cleavage of pro-IL-1(3 into its active form in macrophages. Notably, AI-Cells specifically induce anti-inflammatory mem-ory-like hepatic macrophages in ALF mice, which prevent constitutive overproduction of IL-1(3 when liver re -injury occurs. In light of AI-Cells' precise delivery and training of memory-like hepatic macrophages, they offer promising therapeutic potential in reversing ALF by finely controlling inflammatory responses and orchestrating liver homeostasis, which potentially affect the treatment of various types of liver failure.
